many people have of ‘ chemical ’ , and\nThis poster series break down all the major ingredient in popular natural food — use E-numbers and IUPAC name instead of common name where they exist .\nHere ’ s the banana poster :\nAs a high-school chemistry teacher , I make these poster for my student a a visual introduction to our organic chemistry course .\nIn regard to banana , they be very plentiful in this chemical .\nAs for pectin it be what shape the banana and make it turn from a vivid green to bold yellow , and then a brown-black color ( ripen ) .\nEffect of induced ripen agent include calcium carbide , potash , and leaf of Irvingia gabonensis and Jatropha curcas leave on nutritional and mineral composition of banana be study by Sogo-Temi et al .\nThe banana ripen process can be enhance use artificial ripen agent such a ethylene gas , ethephon , acetylene ( emit from calcium carbide ) , ethylene glycol , and alkyl alcohol ( contain 6-14 carbon atom such a lauryl alcohol ) .\nSince banana be a climactic fruit , induced ripening be essential in commercial scale banana cultivation and distribution to assure good flavour , texture , and uniform peel colour .\n, 2011 , which show that sensory quality and other physicochemical quality attribute be excellent in ethephon ( 500-1000 ppm ) treat banana compare to naturally ripen fruit at the day of storage .\nIn some

chemical on worker , wildlife , and tropical environment in general .\nSufficient data currently exist to conduct a formal environmental risk assessment of the use of agricultural chemical on banana plantation so that priority for future research and mitigation can be clearly define and plan in the most cost‐effective manner .\nThe company also test different variety of banana to find the one which age the slow , discover Cavendish banana be the best of the bunch .\nPeeled banana be generally taint with very few pesticide residue , accord to USDA analysis , probably because those test be peel first .\nThe Cavendish banana be especially susceptible to the fungus because every one of these banana be a cloned , genetic replica of all the others .\nA highly virulent and incurable strain of a fungus know a Panama disease , which afflict the Cavendish banana – the major type of banana that be import into the U.S. -- be spread across plantation around the world ( Butler 2013 ) .\nIn the present review , historical background , cultivar classification , beneficial phytochemical , antioxidant activity and health benefit of banana be discuss .\nBanana contain several bioactive compound , such a phenolic , carotenoid , biogenic amine and phytosterols , which be highly desirable in the diet a they exert many positive effect on human health and well-being .\nIn laboratory test , BanLec , the lectin find in banana , be as potent a two current anti-HIV drug .\nA potent new inhibitor of HIV , derive from banana , may open the door to new treatment to prevent sexual transmission of HIV

amino acid .\nAgain , due to the unique combination of vitamin E and antioxidant , the peel of a banana be even good to use than some store-bought remedy .\nIn fact , banana be spray with more pesticide compare to other tropical fruit because of the fruit ’ s thick peel .\nHowever , research indicate that banana may play a more indirect role by shore up the amount of serotonin the brain be able to produce.﻿﻿ The body need other nutrient to properly make and use serotonin , include vitamin B6 , ﻿﻿ and banana be an especially rich source of this vitamin .\nTo combat these risk factor , most banana farmer and fruit company turn to a cocktail of pesticide that can help reduce the damage from each of the banana 's many enemy .",

    "evidence": "21 mln drop in China 's mobile user may suggest high coronavirus death toll : Report\nA major drop of 21 million cellphone user in China over the past few month may indicate a high death toll due to the coronavirus than what the Chinese government have officially announce , a report by The Epoch Times newspaper , which oppose the Communist Party of China , suggest .\nAs of Monday , accord to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) data , the death toll in Italy amount to 10,781 out of 97,689 confirmed case , and in China it ’ s 3,310 death out of total of 82,447 confirmed case .\nThe Epoch Times ’ report say : “ the big question be whether the dramatic drop in cellphone account reflect the account closing of those who have die ” due to the coronavirus .\n21 million cell phone account in China be cancel after coronavirus\nThis sudden drop suggest a very high Coronavirus death toll\nSince the outbreak of Novel Coronavirus which emerge in China 's Wuhan , the pandemic have kill 15,374 people globally and infect 351,731 individual .\nBut recently Beijing authority announce on March 19 that more than 21 million cell phone account be cancel while in past three month 840,000 landline be close in China , which give an idea that probably these close number belong to the people who die due to the disease .\nBeijing claim that the health code have help China to prevent the spread of Coronavirus in the country where 81,496 people get infect by the COVID-19 .\nIt should be note that a per the report China Telecom be the second-largest carrier which have lose 5.6 million user in February 2020 and lose 0.43 million user in January 2020 .\nChina record 21 million few mobile phone subscriber for the first quarter of 2020 , fuel conspiracy theory that the ‘ lose ’ account belong to victim of coronavirus .\nWhile 21 million dead from coronavirus in China be unlikely ( The Epoch Times only go as far a to say the mobile phone figure be a “ data point ” suggest that the real mortality rate may be much high ) , there appear to be grow consensus that China be not be truthful on it COVID-19 figure .\nSuggestions as many a 21 million people have die from coronavirus in China be base on a simplified analysis of telecommunication data that the Chinese government make publicly available last month .\nHe say the sudden drop in mobile phone account be undoubtedly due to the outbreak of the pandemic in China , but not necessarily because of million of death .\n“ ( That be ) that the Chinese government be understate the number of death inside China from the virus , to delude it own people over the fact it ’ s still not under control , and to tell the rest of the world it have triumph over the pandemic when it hasn ’ t .\nHowever , several Chinese civilian have leak out video and document dispute these number , with many point to the drop in cellphone user by 21 million in the last three month .\nChina Mobile , the large carrier in the country , hold about 60 percent of the Chinese cellphone market , gain 3.732 million more account in December 2019 after the facial scan requirement , but lose 0.862 million in January 2020 and 7.254 million in February 2020 .\nThe Xi Jinping government which control all the news and information , claim that 3,270 people have die and 81,093 infect in China due to COVID-19 , which originate in Wuhan city of Hubei province .\nThe newspaper quote the operation data of all three Chinese cellphone carrier , which show that cellphone account increase in December 2019 but drop steeply since the outbreak of novel coronavirus .\nThe economic slowdown , dislocation of worker cause by shutdown in China may have also lead some people who have an extra cellphone to cancel it .\nIt seem that China , the most smartphone-dependent country in the world ( there be 1.6 billion register mobile account for an adult population of 1.1 billion people ) , have see 21 million mobile account vanish in the past three month .\nAnother , even scary possibility be that the large number of cancel mobile account appear in the two month that represent the height of the Covid-19 epidemic in China be an indicator that the death toll from the disease be several order of magnitude high than the Chinese have report .\nIn two month , about 21.93 million mobile account in China disappear .\nIn short , the process of obtain a mobile number be daunt enough that , once complete , an account holder be reluctant to part with it , which be reflect in the constant subscriber growth of China ’ s three telecommunication provider — China Mobile , China Telecom , and China Unicom — over the past 10 year .\nIn December 2019 , China Mobile , the large of the three telco , add 3.732 million subscription .\nTwenty-one million account be just 1.3 percent of 1.6 billion , but to understand why the figure be nevertheless significant , one have to understand how embedded mobile communication be in everyday Chinese life .\nSo when major cellphone carrier in China report a loss in nearly 21 million subscription in January and February , some skeptic theorize that the number of phone number that disappear from the original hotspot of the disease may correlate to the real number of life lose to the novel coronavirus .\nOfficially , China report nearly 82,000 case of the coronavirus and around 3,300 death , with only a handful of new case each day , and announce the country be largely in recovery a China end it lockdown of Wuhan , the city of 11 million people where the outbreak begin .\nAccording to data publish by the mobile carrier , China Mobile Ltd. saw a drop of nearly 7.25 million subscriber and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. lose 7.8 million subscriber in January and February , while China Telecom Corp. lose 5.6 million subscriber in February alone , the Associated Press report .\nAs the coronavirus pandemic continue to devastate the world in way no one ever imagine , some be question whether China be lie about the extent of COVID-19's impact on it own country .\n”\nHoffman explain factor other than the drop in cell phone subscription point to her conclusion , the most obvious one be China ’ s “ long history of lie about death toll .\nSo do the sudden drop in subscriber necessarily point to the number of coronavirus-related fatality in China ?\nChina Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. subscriber fell by 7.8 million in the period , while China Telecom Corp. have say it lose 5.6 million user last month .\nThe rare industrywide slump in subscriber show the pandemic crisis that first emerge in China late last year be crimp growth even at business that provide essential service and earn monthly revenue .\nChina ’ s wireless carrier be report drop in user a the coronavirus crisis cut business activity , with China Mobile Ltd. , the world ’ s large carrier , report it first net decline since start to report monthly data in 2000 .\nDevastated by a SARS outbreak in 2003 , the country have spend year invest and prepare for viral outbreak and , in some case , disinformation campaign from neighbor China .\nWhat start in China a a containment strategy build atop it surveillance ecosystem have spread globally , keep track with the virus itself .",

    "evidence": ", property manager didn ’ t receive her subsidy from the USDA this month and be and unable to reach her contact there , she tell her tenant to either cover the miss portion of the rent or face eviction .\nBesides ban eviction base on late housing authority payment , the federal government prohibits landlord from ask a voucher-holder to cover rent leave unpaid by the Section 8 program .\nThis mean that a property owner can not require a Section 8 tenant to pay the housing authority ’ s portion of the rent or evict a tenant because the housing authority ’ s payment be delay .\nIt ’ s against federal law to hold a Section 8 voucher-holder accountable for a local housing authority ’ s failure to pay the rent .\nSo if the government shutdown continue and HUD funding dry up , housing authority may not be able to make timely rent payment past next month .\nTenants in Huntsville who rely on federal funding to help pay their rent be express concern about future funding during the government shutdown .\nPrivate landlord who participate in the Section 8 voucher program offer affordable housing to low-income tenant in return for monthly rental subsidy from local housing authority fund by the federal government .\nPublic housing official say they don ’ t know how long rental assistance payment will keep come from the government , and a suspension could put million of tenant at risk if the shutdown drag on into February .\nOne landlord in Arkansas have already send a letter to tenant , explain that they be now responsible for the portion of their rent previously subsidize by the government .\nThe shutdown 's effect on affordable housing could be felt long after Washington resume operation , expert say , since it will make it hard than it already be to get landlord to participate in government assistance program , Todman say .\nFor tenant-based voucher , if the government doesn ’ t reopen before the end of February , the program will run out of funding before the housing authority make voucher payment to landlord nationwide when March rent be due .\nBecause there be no firm indication of when the shutdown will end , tenant be face with the difficult task of very quickly come up with the portion of their rent normally subsidize by the government .\nOn the other hand , landlord can wait for the shutdown to end and hope that the government eventually catch up on pay subsidy .\nIf they wait on the government , they lose rent income in the interim , at the very least , with no guaranty of recoupment .\nHUD have issue a letter ask that landlord instead use their reserve to cover funding shortfall cause by the non-payment of monthly rent subsidy .\nForce majeure clauses typically require rent payment , even in the face of event outside of the tenant ’ s reasonable control that prevent the tenant from perform it other obligation under a contract .\nForce majeure clauses typically require rent payment , even in the face of event outside of the tenant ’ s reasonable control that prevent the tenant from perform it other obligation under a contract .\nIf the federal shutdown isn ’ t resolve before the end of next month ,

country when the rent come due on March 1 .\nDuring a government shutdown , a court must stay a proceeding for repossession of residential rental property for failure to pay rent if the defendant provide certain evidence that be satisfactory to the court .\nThe tenant or an occupant of the property that be the subject of the proceeding must provide evidence satisfactory to the court that the tenant/occupant :\nThe court ’ s stay be for a period of time that the court consider reasonable , but the stay can not be grant for a period that end more than 30 day after the end of the government shutdown without a sufficient showing of cause by a party to the case .\nWhile housing choice voucher be fund through February , if March payment do n't come in , tenant in those 5,200 household will have to hope that their landlord will be understanding .\nAs the government shutdown continue into it second month , it 's become clear that thousand of Inland Northwest family could be put in a precarious housing situation if federal funding be n't provide by March .\nCities and state have try to address housing trouble by pass eviction moratorium , which should prevent an immediate rise in homelessness but doesn ’ t resolve what happen in three or four month when tenant who have have little or no income be bill for month of back rent .\nOn January 4 , HUD send a letter to 1,500 landlord who house tenant under various rental assistance program , include Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance , urge them not to initiate eviction for tenant over HUD funding that have now

be appropriate , or in situation where life or property be threaten , but should the shutdown carry on , much of that funding would lapse , and HUD wouldn ’ t be able to renew it while the government remain closed .\nTo protect renter from lose their home , a grow number of city and state have put a temporary halt on eviction , mean that landlord can not evict tenant who fall behind on their rent .\nIf renter household be not able to pay their landlord , and landlord be unable to pay their property tax , mortgage , worker , and contractor , this spiral will worsen already-declining local economic condition .\n“ There ’ s a fear from landlord do program like this that the funding will stop and they have all these people in housing who they can ’ t get to pay , ” she say .\nSeparately , the government shutdown also affect the organization ’ s broad mission of get people off the street and into affordable housing , leave LA Family Housing without federal funding to subsidize the rent of an additional 250 family .\nAnd now that the government have reopen , she be worry that another shutdown will put those same tenant at risk again and that landlord will be less willing to work with the poor and homeless people her organization serf .\nBecause of the government shutdown , the contract wasn ’ t renew for 2019 , so Klasky-Gamer ’ s organization pay it client ’ January rent out of it own limited coffer , hop to be pay back .\nThe General Services Administration , which make the government 's rent payment in arrears after the end of the month , have yet to give landlord a definitive answer on whether they will be able to pay January 's rent amid the government 's funding lapse .\nThe government shutdown , now the long in U.S. history , have some office owner worry their federal tenant might not make the next rent payment on time , potentially hurt their bottom line and create lasting damage to the idea that the government be a stable tenant .\n”\nTenants cover by the ordinance , the mayor say , should include those with federal housing voucher or subsidy and federal employee or contractor who be not be pay because of the shutdown .\nAlso in response to the shutdown , the D.C. Council pass emergency legislation this week require landlord to give tenant who be federal worker , federal contractor , or household member of such worker a 30-day grace period after the government reopen before pursue unpaid rent .\nThe letter also state that owner of property with FHA insured mortgage or 202/811 Capital Advances may submit request for release from their reserve for replacement account to cover funding shortfall cause by non-payment of monthly rental subsidy .\nNothing in this subsection shall be construe to mean that the tenant will not still be obligate to pay lawfully charge rent .\nSome Section 8 voucher recipient receive 30 to 40 percent of their income in rent each month , with the remain rent pay to the landlord by HUD .\nShould the government continue it hiatus , Section 8 voucher holder across the U.S. could lose their assistance , face massive rent increase , or possibly be evict .",

however , the volume of water filter by oyster be not solely a function of the area of oyster habitat , but also of the density and size frequency of the oyster .\nThe eastern oyster , Crassostrea virginica ( Gmelin , 1791 ) , be know to filter particle > 5 μm in size with high efficiency ( Riisgaard 1988 ) and can have a marked effect on light penetration in shallow , calm water , which in turn may have positive impact on other important adjacent habitat , such a seagrass bed ( Newell and Koch 2004 ) .\nIn order to make broad , estuary-scale estimate of the volume of water filter by oyster population nationally , we derive a model of oyster filtration base on the only in situ measurement of oyster filtration currently available ( Grizzle et al .\nFiltration by suspension feeder such a oyster impact water quality by directly remove particulate matter from the water column , with oyster ingest the edible particle and bind reject particle with mucus , then deposit this a pseudofeces onto the sediment surface .\nAny restoration undertake with the goal of water filtration need to account for the density and size distribution of oyster in addition to the area restore .\nTo estimate the contribution of oyster filtration within an estuary , one can model field-based filtration rate by sum the effect of environmental variable , for which the relationship have be derive and for which field measurement be available .\nAlthough increase in oyster filtration alone be unlikely to resolve the water quality concern of many US estuary ( Cerco and Noel 2007 ) , it may be possible to restore this ecosystem service to level at which it will have some beneficial ecological impact locally ( Newell and Koch 2004 ) .\nOne approach for answer that question be to have enough oyster to filter the volume of water in a bay in about the same time it take the tide and river flow to replace this water over time .\nAs they filter water and feed , oyster also deposit waste material onto surround sediment where it fuel growth of helpful bacteria that digest this nitrate-rich waste .\nOyster reef and other bivalve aggregation be among the most effective of all the cleaner of coastal water , filter vast amount of water from which they collect and digest microscopic algae for food .\nUsing knowledge of the past and present extent and condition of oyster reef in estuary around the USA , together with ecological understanding of their filtering capacity we have be able to model the volume of water be filter per bay .\nAt this level of abundance and filtration , oyster be graze and feed at a rate that be probably sufficient to clear the water and keep algal bloom in check for an entire bay .\nGreat bank of oyster can thus yield measurably clear water , support underwater grass and other plant that need light to survive underwater .\nTo understand the variability in the extent of filtration by oyster in the bay and estuary of the USA , we construct a mathematical model that estimate filtration base on individual oyster size , abundance and reef area , as well a water temperature .\nView interactive map\nIn 2010 , the Conservancy begin work with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation , and a large group of shellfish , marine and fishery scientist , to develop the science and tool to determine how many oyster would be need to filter water in a give estuary or bay or how many be need to produce a desired increase in fish .\nwhere a , b , and c be constant , W be oyster DTW in gram , T\n1 be water temperature in °C , and T\nTo determine the mean filtration capacity of the historic oyster population in each estuary by season , we apply Eq .\nThe difference in the proportion of the estuary volume filter by oyster between the Pacific and Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico coast can not simply be explain by the difference between the FR of O. lurida and Crassostrea specie , a be illustrate in Fig .\nGametes deteriorate within a few hour of spawn and can be rapidly dilute by water current ; thus , the proximity of oyster to one another increase the chance of synchronous spawning and successful fertilization .\nOysters be active suspension feeder , acquire food by filter organic material from the water column and deposit copious quantity of particulate waste material on the seafloor .\nOysters , like other bivalve filter feeder , feed on microalgae and be capable of remove large quantity of particulate matter from the water ; they have a larval stage that allow them to be disperse from the immediate site of the parental stock ; and they require a clean , solid substrate on which the larva can settle and cement themselves .\nOyster larva be common in summer in water sample collect in East Coast estuary ( Kennedy , 1996 ) ; however , investigator sample nearshore water off New Jersey for surf clam larvae report see only one or two Crassostrea sp.-like larva during several year of sample in the 1970s and 1990s ( M. Tarnowski , Maryland Department of Natural Resources , Annapolis , personal communication , 2003 ; J. Grassle , Rutgers University , Port Norris , personal communication , 2003 ) .\nIn addition to provide habitat for numerous other specie , a principal ecological function provide by oyster be consider to be their ability to remove , or filter , particle from surround water ( Newell , 1988 ) .\nP. marinus be transmit directly from oyster to oyster , with most new infection occur in the late summer when previously infect oyster die and release parasite into the water ( Ragone-Calvo et al.\nThe potential obviously exist for oyster to be carry long distance during their larval life , both within and between estuary ; the current state of knowledge be insufficient to predict where larva originate from oyster in a particular area will be transport or to estimate the likelihood that larvae from one estuary will be carry , along the coast , to another estuary .\nOysters can become infect by H. nelsoni or P. marinus shortly after they set ; however , infection level in spat be typically very low because the small volume of water pump by these tiny oyster make their chance of encounter infective stage extremely small compare to large oyster .\nDuring this period , the oyster create large reef throughout most of the tributary estuary in the bay with the high abundance often associate in area of reduced predation , either in low-salinity ( < 15 ppt ) water or shallow tidal creek .\nTwo important ecological function have be attribute to oyster : habitat and resource provision and filtration of suspended particle from the water .\nThe oyster be function a an important feedback loop by catalyze the flux of particulate nutrient from the water column to sediment through biodeposits of feces and pseudofeces .\nBy promote the flux of organic material from the water column to the sediment , oyster help retain organic matter that may otherwise be lose from the system .\nMy research indicate that a mature C. virginica filter five liter of water per hour ( Chesapeake Bay Program , American Oyster , 2005 ) , while a mature M. arenaria filter four liter per hour ( Maryland Department of Natural Resources , Soft Shell Clam , 2007 ) .\nNot just good for eat , oyster be also excellent water filter – improve water quality through filter algae , nutrient and suspend matter from the sea water .\nRELATED : Chesapeake Bay Foundation : After record-breaking season , oyster gardener plant oyster\nThough they be small , oyster move multiple gallon of water in a short amount of time .\n`` The reason we put these reef in be one : oyster filter water so they improve the water quality by remove sediment or other organic matter , '' Witherspoon note .\nOysters be filter feeder , which mean they eat by pump water through their gill .\n`` It ’ s a way for u that we can keep our water in good condition both for the people and the other animal live here by give oyster a chance to do their job . ''\nFinally , simplify filtration calculation support in situ result , show that oyster in these setting be likely to process only a small fraction of the water volume pass through each farm during a tidal cycle .\nAlthough large sample size be often able to resolve statistically significant difference in water quality inside vs. outside farm , the effect of oyster aquaculture on observed water quality variable rarely align with the expectation that aquaculture farm would decrease chlorophyll , turbidity and dissolve oxygen level .\nOyster-tecture propose a living reef compose of a woven web of ‘ fuzzy rope ’ that support marine growth , generate a 3D landscape mosaic that attenuate wave and clean million of gallon of harbor water by harness the biotic filtration process of oyster mussel , and eelgrass .\nIn the present study , we utilize satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentration for Pamlico Sound in conjunction with data on water flow velocity , dissolve oxygen concentration , and vary combination of factor consider within the original ‘ Metapopulation Persistence HSI ’ to generate two additional HSI scenario : one focus primarily on identify restoration location that would maximize likelihood of persistence of an individual restore reef and oyster water filtration ecosystem service ( hereafter , ‘ Water Filtration HSI ’ ) , and another that balance long-term oyster population persistence criterion with oyster water filtration ecosystem service consideration ( hereafter , ‘ Water Filtration & Metapopulation Persistence HSI ’ ) .\nSuitability pattern of the ‘ Metapopulation Persistence and Water Filtration HSI ’ ( Fig 2 ) be drive largely by mean chlorophyll a concentration , salinity , dissolve oxygen concentration , and larval export from oyster sanctuary ( i.e.\nThese model have incorporate a range of abiotic and biotic factor of relevance to oyster restoration , such a salinity , bottom type , and water depth .\nHowever , the functional relationship between oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentration , water flow velocity , and dissolve oxygen develop in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of hypothesis relate to optimal condition for oyster reef restoration to maximize water quality enhancement benefit .\nMoreover , the functional relationship between oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentration , water flow velocity , and dissolve oxygen develop in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of hypothesis relate to optimal condition for oyster reef restoration to maximize water quality enhancement benefit .\nFurthermore , the functional relationship between oyster water filtration and chlorophyll a concentration , water flow velocity , and dissolve oxygen apply in this study can guide field- and lab-testing of hypothesis relate to optimal condition for oyster reef restoration to maximize water quality enhancement benefit .\nIn this time lapse video , the clam ’ s water-cleaning efficiency be demonstrate by place 24 littleneck in a 2.5 gallon aquarium contain algae ( density of 396,000 cells/ml ) .\nHis operation be sustainable : He 's take nothing out of the water except the nutrient his oyster have eat , and he 's put nothing in but the cage that hold his oyster .",

Republicans be concern about partisan poll worker game the system during a machine recount , where poll worker manually fee ballot into a machine , rather than the actual voter themselves , a happens

Democrats use the significant number of these undervotes to create the legal justification for the individual inspection of ballot by three-member election canvassing board in Miami-Dade , Broward and Palm Beach counties.These ballot inspection become the enduring image of the 2000 presidential election , those scene in the recount room , where canvass board member , watch closely by lawyer from both party , hold individual cardboard ballot in the air , try to decipher voter intent from a punch card that be n't quite punched.It land the magnifying glass use by Broward County canvass board

number of people blame a design flaw in the Broward County ballot , which place the Senate race in a column underneath voter instruction while the governor ’ s race top the center column of the ballot , Nelson attorney Marc Elias previously argue it be more likely a machine calibration problem .\nMultiple shortcoming contribute to a problem-plagued 2018 election in Broward County , many of which be

in some case , it functionary even identify and round up Jews or perform other unsavory duty on behalf of their German master .\n[ 84 ] A year after the organisation inception , Göring write in a British publication about have create the organisation on his own initiative and how he be `` chiefly responsible '' for the elimination of the Marxist and Communist threat to Germany and Prussia .\nIn late 1933 , the Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick want to integrate all the police force of the German state under his control .\n[ 37 ]\nShortly after the Nazis come to power , they decide to dissolve the 28 federation of the General German Trade Union Confederation , because Hitler—after note their success in the work council elections—intended to consolidate all German worker under the Nazi government 's administration , a decision he make on 7 April 1933 .\n[ 136 ] Lastly , the Gestapo 's effectiveness , while aid by denunciation and the watchful eye of ordinary Germans , be more the result of the co-ordination and co-operation amid the various police organ within Germany , the assistance of the SS , and the support provide by the various Nazi Party organisation ; all of them together form an organised persecution network .\n[ 85 ] Describing the activity of the organisation , Göring boast about the utter ruthlessness require for Germany 's recovery , the establishment of concentration camp for that purpose , and even go on to claim that excess be commit in the beginning , recount how beating take place here and there .\n[ 9 ]\nConcerned that Diels be not ruthless enough to effectively counteract the power of the Sturmabteilung ( SA ) , Göring hand over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934 .\n[ 137 ]\nAs an instrument of Nazi power , terror , and repression , the Gestapo operate throughout occupy Europe .\n[ 86 ] On 26 April 1933 , he reorganise the force 's Amt III a the Gestapa ( better-known by the `` sobriquet '' Gestapo ) , [ 87 ] a secret state police intend to serve the Nazi cause .\n[ 22 ]\nThe Gestapo have the authority to investigate case of treason , espionage , sabotage and criminal attack on the Nazi Party and Germany .\nThe SS officer Werner Best , one-time head of legal affair in the Gestapo , [ 27 ] sum up this policy by say , `` As long a the police carry out the will of the leadership , it be act legally '' .\n[ 105 ] Over time , membership in the Gestapo include ideological training , particularly once Werner Best assume a leading role for train in April 1936 .\n[ 96 ] The Gestapo also maintain office at all Nazi concentration camp , hold an office on the staff of the SS and Police Leaders , and supply personnel a need to formation such a the Einsatzgruppen .\nHis first order be to defund and eliminate the police department so that they would not interfere with his Brown Shirts\nThe above meme confuse a lot of aspect of the Nazi Machtergreifung into a factually incorrect narrative .\nAs Prussian Minister of the Interior , Göring have broad power over the police for much , although not all , of Germany .\nThe Nazification of the police counter-intuitively coupled centralization of police with elimination of rule regulate German police .\nBut the focus on purge and centralization of power obscure the fact that Göring do not have to do much to transform German police into an instrument of a dictatorship .\nGöring 's various initiative centralized German police to an unparalleled degree , which suit a number of Republic-era critic who felt that German policing be too decentralize to meet modern crime .\nSo the German police , with few notable exception , be politically prim to fall under NSDAP rule .\nSo the German police , with few notable exception , be politically prim to fall under NSDAP rule .\nGöring use his authority to purge any police official who be Social Democrats or otherwise would stand in the way of the NSDAP 's program to destroy the Republic and meet vengeance against the NSDAP 's political enemy .\nInstead , they become tool of Nazi repression .\nWhen the Nazis come to power in 1933 , Hermann Göring , then Prussian minister of the interior , detach the political and espionage unit from the regular Prussian police , fill their rank with thousand of Nazis , and , on April 26 , 1933 , reorganize them under his personal command a the Gestapo .\nGestapo , abbreviation of Geheime Staatspolizei ( German : “ Secret State Police ” ) , the political police of Nazi Germany .\nNominally under the Ministry of the Interior , Germany ’ s police , include the political police , the detective force , and the uniformed police force , be now unify under Himmler .\nThe Gestapo ruthlessly eliminate opposition to the Nazis within Germany and it occupied territory and , in partnership with the Sicherheitsdienst ( SD ; “ Security Service ” ) , be responsible for the roundup of Jews throughout Europe for deportation to extermination camp .\nSimultaneously , Heinrich Himmler , head of the SS , the Nazi paramilitary corp , together with his aide Reinhard Heydrich , similarly reorganize the police of Bavaria and the remaining German state .\nShortly after the Nazis come to power in 1933 , local and regional police force be absorb into the newly establish Geheime Staatspolizei ( or Secret State Police , know colloquially by the acronym “ Gestapo ” ) , which in turn be subordinate to the Schutzstaffel ( “ Honor Guard of the Leader ” or for short , the SS ) , the sole loyalty of which be to Hitler .\nGavriel D. Rosenfeld , a historian and history professor at Fairfield University say , `` Let ’ s just say the Nazis do everything BUT defund the police , ” note that Nazis make the police one of the chief recipient of state financial support aside from military spending .\n“ Police be the strong executor of force , but they be only one part of the solution , ” say Uwe Marquardt , a German police officer and vice president of the German Police University .\n“ We have the catastrophic history of the Nazi era , and we have to learn to change the goal from represent state oppression to represent civilian .\nSS troop stand at attentionWhen the Nazis come to power in 1933 , they do not have a detailed plan for Germany ’ s decentralize uniformed , criminal , and political police force .\nHowever , the number and power of the HSSPFs grow a Nazi Germany expand right before and during World War II .\nSS and police leader Himmler , Heydrich , and Kurt Daluege attempt to create administrative structure that would expand and secure their power and the power of the SS and police system .\nHeinrich Himmler ( seat , center ) , chief of the SS , with Reinhard Heydrich ( stand , leave ) , chief of the Reich Main Security Office ... Over the course of the 1930s , Himmler gradually take control of and centralize the police .\nExactly which SS and police official be most powerful in any give region of Germany or Nazi-occupied Europe depend on timing , personality , and skill .\nThe SS and police system compete with the military , the civil service , the Nazi Party , and others to win Hitler ’ s favor .\nHimmler plan to use the executive authority of the police to implement the SS interpretation of Nazi ideology .\nIn fact , the Nazi party actually centralize and fully fund the police during their reign over Germany .\nOnce the Nazis take power , they centralize and fully fund the police to help promote state security through increased staff , more training and modernize police equipment .\nDuring the Weimar Republic , the government that rule before the Nazi Party take power in 1933 , the police be not a well-funded force due to a bad economic fallout after World War I , accord to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum .\nAdolf Hitler fashion himself a a champion of law and order , the Holocaust Memorial Museum say on their website .\nThere be even some on social medium falsely claim that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler also try to defund the police .",

    "evidence": "In 2015 , the Australian government announce that it intend to kill more than 2 million feral cat by 2020 through shooting , trapping , and poisoning , and one council even offer a cat-scalp bounty .\nThe Australian government announce plan to cull up to 2 million feral cat by 2020 in a bid to preserve dozen of native specie that authority claim face extinction because of the cat ' predatory behavior .\n`` By 2020 , I want to see 2 million feral cat cull , five new island and 10 new mainland 'safe haven ' free of feral cat , and control measure apply across 10 million hectare , '' Hunt say .\nThe bulk of the government funding for the plan will go to administer the cull , which will involve baiting , shoot or poison feral cat .\nThese fatal airdrop owe their existence to Australia ’ s national government , which decide in 2015 to try to kill two million feral cat by 2020 , out of grave concern for the nation ’ s indigenous wildlife — in particular , group of small , threatened rodent and marsupial specie for which cat have become a deadly predator .\nDropping lethal sausage from the sky be only part of the country ’ s effort to eradicate feral cat , which also include trap , shoot and devise all manner of poison-delivery vessel .\nEven though large-scale baiting , like the sausage drop from airplane , have prove effective at reduce the number of cat , often by half or more , it have be individual farmer and shooter who have contribute most to the cause : The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology ’ s data show that shooter be responsible for 83 percent of feral-cat death nationally in the first year of Australia ’ s effort .\n” PETA Australia have it reservation , but in principle recognize that feral cat hunt wildlife to a point at which specie can no longer survive .\nDr. Death , whose real name be Dr. Dave Algar and who be the principal research scientist in the Department of Biodiversity Conservation and Attractions for the state of Western Australia , tell me that he begin develop the recipe for the poison sausage by examine cat food in supermarket and observe which flavor most thrill his own two cat .\nThe background to this be that the government of Australia declare a “ war on cat ” in 2015 a a measure to stem native specie extinction , with the goal of kill two million cat by 2020 .\nIf , and it ’ s a big and unsubstantiated if , there be more than two million feral cat in Australia , then the population will multiply by 2020 , especially if space be be make in their ecological niche by kill off compete cat community .\nThis be one reason why the Australian government have commit million in tax dollar to the development of what ’ s be call ( apparently without irony ) a “ humane toxin ” design to kill cat .\nThe rationale for this carnage be the official assessment that there be two to five million feral cat roam around Australia .\nThe obvious assumption in their decision-making be that cat be the primary , if not the only reason that native Australian specie be go extinct at a high rate than elsewhere in the world .\nApproximately 211,000 cat be cull in Australia in 2016 ; the current cull will take place through 2020 , with the goal of eradicate 2 million cat through poison bait , shoot and trapping , the Herald report .\nIt 's rain poison sausage in Australia , in region of the country that be home to thousand of feral cat .\n[ Photos : See the World Through a Cat 's Eyes ]\nAnother type of bait sausage be drop in Australia contain a pellet of the toxic compound para-aminopropiophenone , which cat will swallow whole but small mammal will avoid , SEWPAC report .\nTallies of annual death toll rack up by Australia 's feral cat be staggering : about 316 million bird and 596 million reptile , accord to the Australian Wildlife Conservancy .\nAirplanes drop the deadly bait over dozen of square mile of ground , a part of the Australian government 's initiative to reduce population of feral feline .\nCats be an invasive specie in Australia ; they arrive with European settler in the 1700s , and feral colony be establish in the wild by the 1850s , SEWPAC report .\nWhen the late feral cat cull be announce , in 2017 , Australia Threatened Species Commissioner Gregory Andrews name cat `` the single big threat to our native animal , '' declare that the cull be necessary to safeguard the future of vulnerable wildlife , accord to The Sydney Morning Herald .\nWhile cat lover may be trouble at the prospect of feline be deliberately poison , Australia 's out-of-control feral cat population have decimate the continent 's wildlife for many decade .\nThe Australian example be instructive , where strategy and plan aim at cull two million free-roaming cat by 2020 , yet lack detail a to how this will improve biodiversity objective .\nThe TSS , in particular , aim at kill 2 million free-roaming cat by 2020 , as well assist in the recovery of 40 threatened mammal and bird species87 .\nYet , current policy statement tend to gloss over the importance of societal and ethical value , instead rely on utilitarian ideal to justify culling and the use of poison on the basis that these method be “ net-humane ” :\nWhen consider the use of [ poison ] … , it 's important to think about whether it will be effective , and whether the action be justified , include the impact of not take those action on the nightly slaughter and maiming of threatened specie cause by feral cat .\nSimilarly in NSW , Predation by the Feral Cat Felis catus ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) be list a a threatening process in Schedule 3 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 ( NSW ) .\n” These cat be categorize a “ wild ” or “ feral , ” and accord to the Australian Department of the Environment , threaten the survival of some 139 native specie , result in “ severe to catastrophic ” impact on Australian biodiversity3 .\nIn New South Wales , deer be now

Abbott ( 6 ) , 4 ; ( 13 ) .\nActing on feral cat be net -humane because it save million of native animal lives…It be not realistic or feasible to trap neuter and release million of feral cat across the more than seven million square kilometre of the Australian continent… [ it ] would not be humane , effective , or justifiable… .\nAt the Commonwealth level , the Australian government have directly target free-roaming cat , adopt three threat abatement plan ( TAPs ) : The Threat Abatement Plan for Predation by Feral Cats , 1999 ( 1999 TAP ) ; The Threat Abatement Plan for Predation by Feral Cats , 2008 ( 2008 TAP ) ; and , the late TAP , the Threat Abatement Plan for Predation by Feral Cats , 2015 ( 2015 TAP ) 66 .\nA recent study on the damage attributable to free-roaming cat conclude that they impact on native specie “ through predation , disease transmission , and resource competition… [ as well a be ] the principal cause of extinction of at least one Australian bird subspecies ( Macquarie Island red-fronted parakeet ) 114.\nHowever , this need to be read in conjunction with the TSS that , a already discuss , focus on kill 2 million cat without provide detail a to how regulator will determine whether cull be link to successful biodiversity protection126 .\nFor the purpose of this article , word , and phrase have the following meaning , which have be adapt from the Threat Abatement Plan for Predation by Feral Cats , adopt by the Commonwealth Government of Australia : wild/feral/free-roaming cat be cat who “ live and reproduce in the wild… and survive by hunt or scavenge [ with ] none of their need… [ be ] satisfy intentionally by human ; ” stray cat be those find in urban or rural area and who “ may depend on some resource provide by human but be not own ; ” and , domesticate cat be those who be own and whose “ need be supply by their owners12.\nHowever , it be questionable whether the fact that free-roaming cat threaten native specie in some circumstance , justify the use of lethal measure a the default position on the basis that it be “ net humane.\nImportantly , the strategy stipulate that more research on free-roaming cat be need and that , apart from trap and shoot at ecologically important site , the cat 's “ [ e ] cological role a a predator/competitor need to be determine if a broad-acre control program be contemplated70.\nIn 1913 , W E Abbott , an advisor to the NSW government , use mathematical calculation to demonstrate how grow number of cat would , in a short time , eradicate any residual rabbit , allow “ the balance of nature… [ to ] be restored49 .\nIndeed , the notion of cat a an effective bulwark against rabbit persist into the twentieth century , with one government stock inspector of 18 year ' experience declaring that he know : “ …of no more formidable enemy of the rabbit than the domestic cat in a wild state30.\n•A collation of 91 study be use to estimate Australia 's feral cat population.•Feral cat be present on > > 99.8 % of Australia 's land area.•Feral cat number in Australia fluctuate ( 2.1–6.3 million ) with antecedent rainfall.•Feral cat density be high on small island , and in arid/semi-arid area after rain.•Feral cat impact on Australian biodiversity have be particularly severe .\nThe overall population estimate for Australia 's feral cat ( in natural and highly modified environment ) , fluctuate between 2.1 and 6.3 million , be low than previous estimate , and Australian feral cat density be low than report for North America and Europe .\nNevertheless , cat inflict severe impact on Australian fauna , reflect the sensitivity of Australia 's native specie to cat and reinforce that policy , research and management to reduce their impact be critical .\nIn Australia , feral cat be implicate in most recent mammal extinction and continue to threaten native specie .\nFeral cat prey on bilby , but separate the two specie seem to be an increasingly improbable strategy for bilby conservation ( Credit : Arid Recovery/Hugh McGregor )\nOf course , cat and fox be already put strong selective pressure on Australia 's native specie – so strong that many be no long around .\nIn Australia , it 's be propose that gene drive could be use to reduce or even eliminate feral cat .\nIt 's estimate that there be as many a six million feral cat in the country , and that they kill some 800 million native animal annually .\nThe Curiosity® bait for feral cat be a small meat-based sausage contain a small hard plastic pellet encapsulate a humane toxin .\nCuriosity® : the Australian Government lead the $ 5.9 million project to develop the Curiosity® bait for feral cat .\nThis bait comprise a small meat-based sausage inject with a synthetic toxin know a 1080 which replicate a naturally-occurring poison find in some plant specie in Western Australia .\nPoison bait intend for feral cat must be lay on the ground ( a cat , unlike other feral specie such a fox , will not dig up a buried bait ) .\nRecord feral cat management activity , include feral cat sighting , eradication and impact on native specie via FeralCatScan – a free app available for download onto iPhone and Android device .\nThe focus on cat in the Threatened Species Strategy may have raise public awareness about the impact of cat and instigate other action , such a the declaration of feral cat a an establish pest animal in the State of Victoria .\nThe most well‐publicized target have be the target to cull 2 million feral cat Felis catus by 2020 .\nHere , we argue that the well‐publicized target to cull 2 million feral cat have a weak scientific basis because : ( 1 ) reliable estimate of Australia 's cat population size do not exist when the target be set ; ( 2 ) it be extremely difficult to measure progress ( number of cat kill ) in an accurate , reliable way ; and , most importantly , ( 3 ) the cull target be not explicitly link to direct conservation outcome ( e.g.\nSimilar to the Predator Free New Zealand initiative ( Linklater & Steer , 2018 ) , Australia 's Threatened Species Strategy have be criticize for it overwhelming focus on cat compare to other threaten process that endanger large number of plant and animal specie , especially habitat loss ( Cresswell & Murphy , 2017 ; Evans et al.\nSimilar to the 2 million cat cull target , the degree to which meet these area‐based target will benefit threatened specie be unclear because no link have be make to the efficacy of these action in term of either reduced cat or increase threatened specie population density .\nWhen the Threatened Species Strategy target be develop , there be no reliable estimate of the number of feral cat in Australia .\nOther target relate to feral cat be eradication

emergency intervention to avert extinction .\nWe argue that the 2 million cat target have a weak scientific basis because : ( 1 ) there be no reliable estimate of the number of feral cat in Australia when the target be set ; ( 2 ) it be extremely difficult to measure progress ( number of cat kill ) in a robust way ; and ( 3 ) the cull target be not explicitly link to direct conservation outcome (
