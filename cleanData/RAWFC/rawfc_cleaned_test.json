    "evidence": "In contrast to the varied definition for mass shooting , there be an agreed-upon definition among government agency for active shooter : “ an individual actively engage in kill or attempt to kill people in a confined and populated area ; in most case , active shooter use firearm ( s ) and there be no pattern or method to their selection of victim ” ( U.S. Department of Homeland Security , 2008 , p. 2 ) .\nAlthough there be no official standard for the casualty threshold that distinguish a mass shooting from other violent crime involve a firearm , a common approach in the literature be to adopt the FBI ’ s criterion for a mass murderer and set a casualty threshold of four fatality by firearm , exclude the offender or offender ( Duwe , ­Kovandzic , and Moody , 2002 ; Krouse and Richardson , 2015 ; Gius , 2015c ; Fox and Fridel , 2016 ) .\nData collection effort by Mass Shooting Tracker and the Gun Violence Archive thus count all incident that meet their designate casualty threshold a mass shooting , regardless of the circumstance that lead to the event .\nIn their analysis of mass shoot trend from 1999 to 2013 , Krouse and Richardson ( 2015 ) distinguish between mass shooting occur in public location that be indiscriminate in nature ( “ mass public shooting ” ) , mass shooting in which the majority of victim be member of the offender ’ s family and that be not attributable to other criminal activity ( “ familicide mass shooting ” ) , and mass shooting that occur in connection to some other criminal activity ( “ other felony mass shooting ” ) .\n»\nEven when a more restrictive casualty threshold of four or more fatally injure victim ( exclude the shooter ) be impose , empirical evidence on trend in these incident varies depend on whether the motivation of the shooter be include a a criterion for consider an event a mass shooting .\nFor instance , Lott and Landes ( 2000 ) adopt the definition of two or more injured victim , the Gun Violence Archive ( undated-a ) define mass shooting a an incident in which four or more victim ( exclude the shooter ) be injure or kill , and Mass Shooting Tracker ( undated ) set a criterion of four or more people injure or kill ( include the shooter ) .\nIn the 1980s , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) define mass murderer a someone who “ kill four or more people in a single incident ( not include himself ) , typically in a single location ” ( Krouse and Richardson , 2015 ) .\nMost mass shooting in the U.S. be carry out by men , with white men make up nearly 50 percent of the shooter , the database show .\nIn 2018 , the year be mark by a surge in mass killing in public place , include school in Texas and Florida .\nBetween 2009 and 2018 , the five deadly mass shoot incident in the US all involve the use of assault weapon and high-capacity magazine : Las Vegas , Orlando , Newtown , Sutherland Springs , and Parkland.10Las Vegas , Nevada : 58 death ; Orlando , Florida : 49 death ; Newtown , Connecticut : 27 death ; Sutherland Springs , Texas : 25 death ; Parkland , Florida : 17 death .\nAlthough many people think of mass shooting a random act of violence , this analysis show that most mass shooting be not at all random : In at least 54 percent of mass shooting between 2009 and 2018 , the perpetrator shoot a current or former intimate partner or family member during the rampage .\nStates with restriction on magazine size experience mass shooting at less than half the rate of state without restrictions.16Sam Petulla , “ Here Is 1 Correlation between

mass shooting a incident in which four or more people – exclude the shooter – be shoot or kill .\nThis be a difficult question to answer because there be no single , agreed-upon definition of the term “ mass shooting.\nAs state in “ A Guide to Mass Shootings in America , ” the editor of Mother Jones ’ Website write , “ Our research have focus on indiscriminate rampage in public place result in four or more victim kill by the attacker .\nIn the current study , we have gather relevant information about mass shooting that occur within the U.S. in the past 30 year to assess whether there be any

unfair to say that they be not as smart a we be , or they don ’ t have the same cognitive capacity a we do .\nThis be certainly the case with elephant in many part of Asia , where encroach human

warning not to use with bleach .\nMost dish soap carry a warning not to use with bleach .\nI wash my dish and clothes in bleach with dawn and I make my dish soap with out bleach but I add a teaspoon of ammonia to my dish soap I rinse my dish very well I have never have a problem I have a spray bottle with strong bleach water and i spray my dish with that before I always do them and never have a bleach ammonia mix reaction it ’ s just do regular dish and they come out shiny and grease cut and squeaky clean and I some time put dawn and bleach in a hot sink of water and I never have any problem there either , I have never mixed complete bleach and complete ammonia together with out water I know that will make a deadly gas but in my dish water in bleach sprayed dish\nhome make dish soap with ammonia in it and dawn doesn ’ t do anything when I do my dish plus I would never dream of do my dish with out bleach I use it with and on everything and the teaspoon of ammonia in my home make gallon dish soap well that ’ s 2 gallon some time it make 2 gallon of dish soap with 1 tea spoon of ammonia ether way nothing happen but bright clean dish rinse twice I ’ ve be do that about 20 year ammonia the teaspoon of ammonia be a perfect grease cutter and it make thing shine like a dish washer , Remember keep the love between you and your dish , wear glove and enjoy what you be do Knowing your home make dish soap work jut like dawn \nmy dish soap turn into a very thick gel I use old dawn pump dish soap container and the rest in gallon jug I just keep add water and it be just as good at the end of the home make product a it be in the beginning when I first make it also when ever I get orange I peel my orange than i push the piece through the top of my dish soap container , it never go rancid it also go in my bleach spray and every single cleaning concoction I make , I never have a problem there , also I add witch hazel teaspoon keep the hand soft when you don ’ t have glove plus it be a great cleaner plus I add lavender or some other good smell epsom salt And a teaspoon of purex crystal or a teaspoon of calgon , again I rinse my dish high powered water by put my finger over the spigot of the faucet , and just under the running water than when they be do I do it again , calgon be a great water softener .\nThe Dawn dish soap bottle contain the same small bleach warning , but NO list of ingredient .\nActually the water be still sudsy and you can feel and can plainly see the result on your disinfected dish\nDawn have a patented Lithium base , Lithium be an Amine , but there be no ammonia in it , it the only soap with this formula and thus the only dish soap safe for use on wildlife , most likely the mixing of Dawn with Bleach create a chlorine gas , if you buy pool shock treatment ( lithium chlorine ) and drop in a sink full of water , it ’ ll quickly choke you out of the house .\nNeedless to say , I end up “ rinse ” the floor and know good than to mix dish soap with bleach now ( unless some other brand of dish soap be okay to use with bleach or have bleach in it already )\nThey should probably post the entire ingredient list on the bottle too , because that would ’ ve stop me there if I have see the alcohol in it .\nShe also point out that there be NO list of ingredient on the back of the dish soap bottle to give you any inkling of what might be in there ( maybe ammonia ! )\nIn conclusion , NOT a good idea to mix bleach and dish soap that contain alcohol .\nSo the best I can discern with my layman ’ s understanding be that this ammonia derivative be in fact the likely reason for dish soap to give a warning about not add bleach .\nHere ’ s the link to the foam dish soap tutorial :\nI ’ m sure it ’ s not a good idea to mix dawn and bleach together , but that be not what the author be suggest .\ndon ’ t listen to her she be tell you to mix 2 chemical with out any water , a recipe for disaster , always make sure you be work with a sink full of water before add your chemical solution I add a teaspoon of ammonia to a gallon or 2 of water for my dish soap recipe , also I add a half of a teaspoon to the bottle , I pour in the home make dish soap mostly full shake it , and use my bleach water spray and spray over the dish the dish soap will gel than keep add water till it ’ s go\nThanks for the good info .\nI just get do wash the floor with dish soap , bleach and hot water ( I also [ use ] to mix a little bleach with the dish soap for my dish )\nAfter I be do , I look at the other side of the dish soap and saw the “ do not mix with chlorine bleach ” .\nThe problem with mix bleach and Dish soap be actually that chemically speak , the soap inhibit the bleach ’ s ability to sanitize and/or disinfect .\nMixing ammonia and bleach together result in toxic fume that be very dangerous and cause extreme irritation to the eye and lung and can even result in death .\nThe water guy\nI have be use Dawn dish soap for year and always put a small amount of bleach in the mix , I have never experience any negative effect , BTW , my mother do the same thing for many year .\nI too have use bleach with my homemade Dawn laundry soap , not know not to mix them , and I ’ m still here without any problem that I ’ m aware of lol .\nAnyways , to be specific on the dish soap I use , it be Great Value ’ s Ultra Concentrated Dishwashing Soap and I look at the ingredient .\nThe first piece of the puzzle in answer the “ mix Dawn with bleach ” question come from remember again that there be two substance that should never be mixed together : Ammonia and Bleach .\nI would assume that add dish soap and water dilute the dawn before you add bleach .\nMix some dish soap with some bleach.. Outside , please .\nI have an experience with ammonia and bleach be mixed\nand I would never even try it in my at home washer not even for a test .\nIt would likely include the weight of the amine ( or ammonia , since combine with H2O likely provide the H2 ) , but not the weight of the rest of the ingredient in the detergent .\nThe problem with that be that you may be mix bleach and ammonia without actually know it and you may not experience any type of smell fume or odor at the time and think everything be fine but in fact you be make a chemical reaction with two chemical that be not suppose to be mixed whatsoever .\ncompany send people to make comment against anything that work as good or good than the cleaning product they sell , they will anything from “ it ’ s dangerous ” to random death incidence , we have be use my recipe from my great grand parent , no history of breathe problem ect , and those With breathing problem be not prove to be directly relate to home make solution , also there be nothing wrong with wear a simple light comfortable mask and glove because everything a house hold use to clean , home make or not Are chemical and it ’ s just smart and keep your cleaning area well ventilate be another practice bring down from generation , window open let fresh air circulate a tiny fan the door open , there be many way to ventilate fresh air but like I be say , stop what work best for you have experience no problem and read some post isn ’ t a reason to go out and buy chemical that be just a bad if not bad , cost more money and keep you spend a lot when you have a couple product at home , use appropriately be a much good option\nI ’ m so glad you explain some reason regard Dawn ingredient .\nAlso , when I saw the warning you point out on the bottle of Dawn I go to the kitchen pull out the bottle of Dawn , there be no such warning on the bottle and it do have a list of ingredient .\nTo make a batch of my homemade laundry soap make with Dawn , I use 2 tablespoon of Dawn dish soap in a gallon of water .\nLove your article and I will share it with one of my post , but I do have to tell you that I use a very Dawn dish soap to clean my kitcken sink fallowed by a very diluted version of 10/100 bleach to water which I spray on the sink before rinse .\nBUT – not that long ago when I look at the back of the bottle of Dawn dish soap I spot these tiny word : “ Do Not Add Bleach ” .\nI forget to mention that you could simply just use *THICK BLEACH instead of the thin bleach which I be assume that you be use to mix with dish soap .\nAnd of course the maker of dish soap be expect u to be wash our dish in a little sink with the product , and not our clothing in a big ole wash machine .\nThis be a much different ratio than if you be to combine a squirt of Dawn dish soap and bleach to wash dish in a small sink full of water ( maybe about one gallon of water ) .\nLast week I be research some unexpected homemade stain remover and that get me think about another homemade laundry product – my homemade no-grate laundry soap make with Dawn dish soap .\nI ’ ve use Dawn ultra and mix a little bleach to wash my floor , there be no warn sign on the bottle to say not use bleach .\nSo apparently the warning find on some dish soap that you should not add bleach stem from this potential chemical reaction .\nKathy , I have accidentally make ammonia mix generic dish soap and wash soda !\nShe squirt some dish soap on the dish in the sink with some hot water and then glugged in a little bleach and leave thing to sit and soak , but then start feel sick and dizzy .\nSo to be super cautious , we would make the decision to not add any bleach to a laundry load when use our homemade Dawn laundry soap .\nHUGZ\nAfter I read the homemade laundry soap with Dawn / add bleach question.I figure if I use 1cup bleach in a large load , 1/2 cup in a med .\nThe thick bleach ( the basic kind you squirt around your toilet ) be simply just thin bleach pre-mixed with a basic detergent solution ( sans all the extra chemical that can have an adverse toxic chemical reaction – a such with common dish soap ) .\nSo she check the label on her Palmolive dish soap and be frustrate to see a tiny “ Do Not Add Bleach ” warn which she interpret to mean “ Hey your dish will be so clean you win ’ t even need bleach !\nMaybe not to the same degree a the diluted Dawn in your home make laundry detergent , but it ’ s sort of irresponsible to conclude that because it be safe for you , someone with lung issue might not have the same result .\nHowever I think in the future I will NOT be combine my homemade Dawn laundry soap with bleach in any small way that do not include lot of water ( such a presoaking ) just to be on the safe side .\nI use sunlight dish soap and bleach in those OXO soap dispenser brush when I want to clean a stainless sink or countertop .\nCan you combine homemade Dawn laundry soap and bleach\nNow we get down to the nitty gritty – the answer we ’ re in search of in the first place .\nRumack note that toilet bowl cleaner , bleach and ammonia product generally all list ingredient on the package , make it possible for consumer to avoid the dangerous mixture .\nHousehold cleaner poison incident can occur with so little warning , expert agree , that the only safe approach be never to mix clean agent , no matter how harmless the combination may seem or how similar -- a in the case of ammonia cleaner and bleach -- the product may smell or otherwise seem to the lay person .\nInstead , the woman involve clean for several hour in small room with little ventilation -- not realize that slight difference in the chemistry of ammonia cleaner and bleach lead to a reaction when the two be combine that produce a gas call chloramine , which can quickly have potentially deadly effect .\nBut there be a warn circulate social medium suggest mix bleach and Dawn dish soap be toxic and could even kill you .\n”\nThe Facebook post also claim ammonia be an ingredient in Dawn .\nHowever , you shouldn ’ t mix dish washing liquid with any cleaner , include bleach .\nThis be not alarmist , either : Improper use of cleaning product — especially one that contain bleach , alcohol , or ammonia — really do kill people .\nBut because it ’ s essentially pre-diluted dish soap , it could be use a a substitute for dish soap solution — use it to soak pot and pan , use it a a floor mop solution , use it to wash a car* , etc .\nAmmonia and Bleach : According to Dong and Lu , this be a combination that commonly occurs by accident because many cleaning product contain ammonia .\nThey may contain different acid and alcohol ( in the case of this Lysol Power Toilet Bowl Cleaner , for example ) , and a discuss above , acid and alcohol can react with bleach to create toxic gas and fume that can be very dangerous to human .\nBleach will likely be an ingredient in a drain cleaner , and you should not mix on drain cleaner with another .\n`` The primary ingredient in chlorinated bleach be sodium hypochlorite , which react with a variety of chemical to produce toxic gas , In general , cleaning product will fall into one of these three category , so it be a bad idea to mix any cleaning product with bleach , '' say Lu .\nWhether it ’ s a glass cleaner , dishwasher detergent , toilet cleaner , floor cleaner , wood cleaner or more , combine bleach with various other cleaning product can result in the production of chlorine gas , result in severe respiratory and ocular problem .\nIf use in combination with bleach , the reaction will result in toxic gas be form .\nWhen bleach be mixed with ammonia contain cleaner , chloramine gas be release .\nBleach be also dangerous when combine with other common chemical and household cleaning product include ammonia , hydrogen peroxide , oven clean , drain cleaner and some detergent .\nExposure to chloramine gas can cause the following symptom :\nIn addition to use ammonia a a cleaning product , ammonia can be find in some glass and window cleaner , interior and exterior paint , and in urine ( use caution when cleaning litter box , diaper pail , or toilet bowl ) .\nWhen bleach be mixed with ammonia , toxic gas call chloramine be produce .\nProducts contain acid include vinegar and some glass and window cleaner , automatic dishwasher detergent and rinse , toilet bowl cleaner , drain cleaner , rust removal product , and brick and concrete cleaner .\nDo n't mix bleach with ammonia , acid , or other cleaner .\nHowever , it can become potentially lethal to inhale when mixed with other household cleaner .\nWhen sodium hypochlorite be mixed with acetic acid or any other type of acid , it release potentially lethal chlorine gas .\nIf you come into contact with bleach on your skin or in your eye , be aware of how to safely…\nA group of researcher discover that when bleach fume mix with a citrus compound find in many household cleaner , it can create potentially…\nBorax , or sodium tetraborate , be a powdery white mineral that have be use a a cleaning product for several decade .\nEven if you don ’ t deliberately combine bleach and vinegar , occasion arise when you might accidentally mix the cleaner during everyday household chore .\nBleach ( or sodium hypochlorite ) be one active ingredient you may see in some disinfecting product .",

    "evidence": "WASHINGTON — Senior Trump administration official on Thursday blame a shortfall of N95 mask early in the coronavirus pandemic on mismanagement after the 2009 swine flu pandemic under former President Barack Obama .\nBright say he be fire last month after resist pressure to boost use of hydroxychloroquine to alleviate COVID-19 symptom , though in his testimony he allege a broad failure to prepare by the Trump administration .\nAs of early this month , the US have 12 million N95 respirator and 30 million surgical mask in it Strategic National Stockpile — which official acknowledge be just 1 percent of what the country need in a full-blown pandemic .\nThe risk be big : If those health care worker get sick and be unable to care for people , more patient be likely go to suffer and die — and not just from Covid-19 , but just about any other medical issue , from heart attack to car crash , that we ’ ll need health care worker for in the next few month .\nDonald Trump have give his first public response to Barack Obama ’ s criticism of the current administration ’ s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic .\nThe simple fact be that President Trump ignore the threat of the coronavirus for month and have mishandle the response at every step since — destroy the strong economy he inherit from the Obama-Biden administration and lead to countless unnecessary death .\nFor week , former president Barack Obama have choose not to respond to the taunt a President Trump seek to deflect responsibility for the widespread coronavirus outbreak in the United States by shift some blame to his predecessor .\n“ As much a former president Obama have an enormous microphone and people still look to hear what he have to say , he also , especially at a time of global crisis , do not want to create a moment that ’ s perceive a political — a battle between a former Democratic president and a sitting Republican president , even if President Trump be completely mishandle this .\nPeople close to Obama , who speak on the condition of anonymity to describe his view , say he also make clear he be not interested in get suck into a political catfight with Trump , leave it to his former aide — most prominently Ron Klain , who serve a Ebola czar in the Obama administration — to parry Trump ’ s partisan attack and correct the public record over misinformation put out by the Trump White House .\n”\nThough people close to the 44th president say the political nature of his message be aim at hold a broad group of Republican politician accountable for dismiss climate science , Obama ’ s decision to step into the political arena amid the lethal spread of the novel coronavirus represent a slight shift in his strategy over the past several week in which he have focus on play a more neutral public role .\n”\nA pandemic year : How future generation will judge humanity ’ s performance against the coronavirus | What it felt like to lose time — and all other

onto his predecessor , complain that a federal agency decision under President Barack Obama have make it hard to quickly enact widespread test for the virus .\nBut President Donald Trump sideline him at point during the year after Fauci ’ s stark warning about the importance of wear mask , social distancing and halt large-scale gathering .\n’ ”\nThe Department of Health and Human Services say last week that the stockpile have about 12 million N95 respirator and 30 million surgical mask —a scant 1 percent of the estimate 3.5 billion mask the nation would need in a severe pandemic .\nResponding to swine flu , which the CDC estimate kill more than 12,000 people in the United States over the course of a year , have require the large deployment in the stockpile ’ s history , include nearly 20 million piece of personal protective equipment and more than 85 million N95 mask , accord to a 2016 report publish by the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering and Medicine .\nAfter use up the swine flu emergency fund , the Obama administration try to replenish the stockpile in 2011 by ask Congress to provide $ 655 million , up from the previous year ’ s budget of less than $ 600 million

his most pathetic blame-shirking yet .",

Professional and home-made face mask reduce exposure to respiratory infection among the general population .\nAlthough mask wearing be intend , in part , to protect others from exhale , virus-containing particle , few study have examine particle emission by mask-wearers into the surround air .\n“ Masks and other face covering be wear primarily to protect others from potentially infectious respiratory droplet or secretion from the person wear the mask — this be source control , ” say David Pegues , a professor of medicine in the division of infectious disease at the University of Pennsylvania .\nThe study of mask a source control also suggest a benefit , and may be important during the COVID-19 pandemic in universal community face mask use as well a in health care setting .\nThe pandemic of COVID-19 be grow , and a shortage of mask and respirator have be report globally .\nThe use of mask by sick people , despite be the WHO 's only recommendation for mask use by community member during COVID-19 pandemic , be support by the small body of evidence .\nUniversal face mask use be likely to have the most impact on epidemic growth in the community , give the high risk of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission ( He et al.\nFor COVID-19 specifically , the grow body of evidence show aerosolisation of the virus in the hospital ward highlight the risk of inadvertent exposure for healthcare worker and support the use of airborne precaution at all time on the ward ( Santarpia et al.\nThe study also do not show efficacy for a surgical mask wear continually , and therefore no difference between a surgical mask and target use of a respirator ( MacIntyre et al.\nWearing a surgical mask prevent virus from be exhale .\nIn general , the result show protection for healthcare worker and community member , and likely benefit of mask use a source control .\nPrior evidence that surgical mask effectively filter influenza virus ( 1 ) inform recommendation that patient with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 should wear face mask to prevent transmission ( 2 ) .\nWhether face mask wear by patient with coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) prevent contamination of the environment be uncertain ( 2 , 3 ) .\nFurther study be need to recommend whether face mask decrease transmission of virus from asymptomatic individual or those with suspected COVID-19 who be not cough .\nThis experiment do not include N95 mask and do not reflect the actual transmission of infection from patient with COVID-19 wear different type of mask .\nIn conclusion , both surgical and cotton mask seem to be ineffective in prevent the dissemination of SARS–CoV-2 from the cough of patient with COVID-19 to the environment and external mask surface .\nExperts clash over research into efficacy of public wear even homemade face covering\nA row have erupt among scientist over a new report into the use of face mask by the general public a an approach to manage the spread of Covid-19 in the community .\nThe report from a multidisciplinary group convene by the Royal Society call Delve – Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics – have weigh up the evidence and come out in favour of the public wearing face mask , include homemade cloth covering , in a bid to tackle Covid-19 .\n“ If correctly use on this basis , face mask , include homemade cloth mask , can contribute to reduce viral transmission .\nA cloth mask provide very good protection , and be more comfortable to wear , ” she say .\nBut health expert say the evidence be clear that mask can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and that the more people wear mask , the good .\n“ I think there ’ s enough evidence to say that the best benefit be for people who have COVID-19 to protect them from give COVID-19 to other people , but you ’ re still go to get a benefit from wear a mask if you don ’ t have COVID-19 , ” say Chin-Hong .\nSurgical mask be generally more protective than cloth mask , and some people find them light and more comfortable to wear .\nThere ’ s a lot of asymptomatic infection , so everybody have to wear a mask .\nAnother study of people who have influenza or the common cold find that wear a surgical mask significantly reduce the amount of these respiratory virus emit in droplet and aerosol .\nOf all the mask study , the late by Duke University researcher affirm the fitted N95 a king in the fight against COVID-19 , the most important remain the study of all study by the University of Washington ’ s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.The IHME , a research center that have provide projection on hospitalization and death during the COVID-19 pandemic , perform a meta-analysis earlier this summer of mask study from the United States , China and Germany that confirm what most medical expert have advocate for month : If 95 percent of people wear cloth mask when within 6 foot of other people in public , it will reduce COVID-19 transmission by at least 30 percent .\nThe IHME , a research center that have provide projection on hospitalization and death during the COVID-19 pandemic , perform a

within 6 foot of other people in public , it will reduce COVID-19 transmission by at least 30 percent .\nBut the conclusion , a in so many other study , have leave little doubt that wear a mask be our best defense against the spread of COVID-19 .\nAUSTIN ( KXAN ) — Researchers at Duke University have develop a new tool to find the effectiveness of the various type of mask people be use to stop spread during the COVID-19 pandemic .\nN95s also fit more securely than a regular face mask do , allow for minimal leakage .\nRecent study suggest that wear face mask reduce the spread of COVID-19 on a population level and consequently blunt the growth of the epidemic curve ( 7 , 8 ) .\nMandates for mask use in public during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , worsen by global shortage of commercial supply , have lead to widespread use of homemade mask and mask alternative .\nThe global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) in early 2020 have substantially increase the demand for face mask around the world while stimulate research about their efficacy .\nThe premise of protection from infected person wear a mask be simple : Wearing a face mask will reduce the spread of respiratory droplet contain virus .\nStill , determine mask efficacy be a complex topic that be still an active field of research [ see , for example , ( 9 ) ] , make even more complicated because the infection pathways for COVID-19 be not yet fully understood and be complicate by many factor such a the route of transmission , correct fit and usage of mask , and environmental variable .\nA simple method be develop for evaluate the efficacy of face mask to reduce respiratory droplet emission during speaking .\nThe CDC have also recently update it guideline advise Americans to avoid face mask with exhalation valve or vent because they aren ’ t a effective in prevent the spread of COVID-19 .\nAnother recent study suggest that a homemade cloth face mask likely need two or three layer to be effective in prevent the spread of the coronavirus .\nThe popularity of homemade face mask have soar a authority simultaneously exhort the public to take precaution against Covid-19 infection and demand that scarce medical-grade equipment be save for health-care professional .\nIn other word , homemade mask be likely to be just a small piece of the puzzle for control the COVID-19 pandemic .\nThe bottom line , expert say , be that mask might help keep people with COVID-19 from unknowingly pass along the virus .\nThe result from influenza and seasonal coronaviruses suggest that surgical mask can help keep people with COVID-19 from spread the virus , Cowling say .\nBut there be still major debate over how much mask — particularly the homemade fabric mask that the CDC recommend for the public — can slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that cause COVID-19 .\nSubsequent research have suggest that face mask be an effective method for contain the spread of the virus , use along with stay six foot apart from other people .\nFace mask be an effective method for contain the spread of the virus , use along with stay six foot apart from other people .\nThese mask , when properly fit , seal closely to the face and filter out 95 % of particle 0.3 micron or large .\nFor the first time , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) have recommend that even seemingly healthy people wear mask over their mouth and nose when venture out of their home into place where it be difficult to maintain distance from other people .\nAs a result of the shortage of mask during the recent COVID-19 pandemic , CDC develop strategy for optimize the supply of mask and recommend use homemade cloth mask when no medical mask be available ( 1 ) .\nThe use of cloth mask during the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) pandemic be under debate .\nAs a result of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , supply of medical mask and respirator be limit globally .\nMoreover , in a widespread pandemic , differentiate asymptomatic from healthy person in the community be very difficult , so at least in high-transmission area , universal face mask use may be beneficial .\nParticipants make mask from different material , and all mask test show some ability to block the microbial aerosol challenge although less than that of medical mask ( 11 ) .\nMultilayer cloth mask , design to fit around the face and make of water-resistant fabric with a high number of thread and finer weave , may provide reasonable protection .\nGauze mask be use during the second Manchurian plague epidemic in 1920–1921 and a plague epidemic in Los Angeles in 1924 ; infection rate among healthcare worker who wear mask be low ( 6 ) .\nSimilarly , WHO also discuss the option of use cloth mask to protect wearer from acquire infection during the 2009 influenza A ( H1N1 ) pandemic ( 15 ) .\nThis finding suggest that risk for infection be high for those wear cloth mask .\nThe filtration effectiveness of cloth mask be generally low than that of medical mask and respirator ; however , cloth mask may provide some protection if well design and use correctly .\nUntil a cloth mask design be prove to be equally effective a a medical or N95 mask , wear cloth mask should not be mandate for healthcare worker .\nFiltration effectiveness of cloth mask varies widely ; some material filter good than others ( 9–11 ) .\nIf you join public gathering , prevent the spread of COVID-19 by wear a mask .\nAccording to a study in Hong Kong , wear a mask in public be effective for the SARS coronavirus ( a virus very similar to the new coronavirus that cause COVID-19 ) .\nThe thing be , many people be not wear mask properly , which cause COVID-19 to spread .\nYou wear a mask to protect me .\nRemember : I wear a mask to protect you .\nIn addition to wear a mask , be aware of your surroundings and use good sense .\n”\nNevertheless , the chart be particularly useful in the context of all the other high-quality evidence show that mask reduce the transmission of the coronavirus and other respiratory disease .\n“ For example , state that have bad outbreak earlier in the pandemic both have high mask usage now and more immunity .\nCameron , who lead the virology group for CWRU 's COVID-19 task force , say in general , there be two type of study that can help researcher determine the effectiveness of mask : correlative ( which look at mask use a a whole within a community or among contact and correlate it with the number of infection in that community ) and lab-controlled ( where researcher test the virus or bacteria on the back of a mask after someone use them ) .\nThe CDC and the Ohio Department of Health be now recommend the use of cloth face covering in public to slow the spread of COVID-19 .\nRelated— '' Understanding Changing Guidance on Mask Use ''\nSurgical mask , homemade mask , and respirator have become symbolic of protection during the COVID-19 crisis .\nNOTE : The CDC recommend all people two year of age and old wear a cloth face mask cover in public setting and when around people who do n't live in your household .\nPrevious research also show that surgical mask can be almost as efficient a N95 respirator at reduce influenza infection among health care personnel .\nThese mask be not recommend during the COVID-19 pandemic .\nThis include the use of cloth mask by large section of the public , a can be see during the current global spread of COVID-19 .\nThe emergence of a pandemic affect the respiratory system can result in a significant demand for face mask .\nThese permission be grant for the duration of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declaration of COVID-19 a a global pandemic .\nIt ’ s amaze that only the recent study that show the effectiveness of wear face mask to reduce the spread of the coronavirus be be publish and none of the 50 odd previous study all do by reputable institution clearly show that they don ’ t work be not even be mention .\nA team of researcher have test everything from t-shirt and sock to jean and vacuum bag to determine what type of mask material be most effective at trap the ultrafine particle which may contain virus such a SARS-CoV-2 , the virus which cause COVID-19 .\nAs for homemade mask , those make of multiple layer of fabric be more effective , and those which also incorporate interfacing , which be normally use to stiffen collar , show a significant improvement in performance .\nJust because he have two mask on ( which doesn ’ t even make sense because they win ’ t fit correctly on your face ) it doesn ’ t mean that he wasn ’ t infect before he decide to wear them .\nShift the focus instead to potentially save a life at any cost and you ’ ll realize there ’ s no downside to wear a mask , even if the chance of you save someone by wear one be actually small .\nBased on current research , here 's a ranking of the best and bad face covering :\nIn addition to protect those around you , mask can also offer protection for the wearer , accord to the CDC 's recent guideline .\nA 2013 study find that surgical mask be about three time a effective at block influenza aerosol a homemade face mask .",

    "evidence": "”\nAnd yet , mandatory vaccination program have exist in the U.S. since the early 20th century , when all child be require to attend elementary school for the first time .\nThe United States be no stranger to mandatory vaccination program and there ’ s plenty of evidence that they can work , but Daniel Salmon , director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , fear attitude towards public health measure have change so rapidly in 2020 that such an approach for COVID-19 could backfire .\nHowever , in those case vaccination be clearly in the child ’ s best interest , a the child receive the benefit of immunity to disease such a measles , that pose a great risk to that child than we currently believe COVID-19 do .\nIn the USA , state regulation mandate that child can not attend school if they be not vaccinate , and healthcare worker be require to vaccinate .\nIn the end , the policy we should adopt towards COVID-19 vaccination will depend on the precise risk and benefit of the vaccine ( and our confidence in them ) , the state of the pandemic , the nature of the alternative , and particularly the public appetite for a vaccine .\nSo we can not say whether a mandatory policy of COVID-19 vaccination be ethically justified until we can assess the nature of the vaccine , the gravity of the problem and the likely costs/benefit of alternative .\nGiven the mount number of death globally , and the apparent failure of many country to contain the pandemic without severely damage or problematic lockdown and other measure , there have be call to make a vaccine , if it be approve , mandatory.2 Mandatory vaccination have not be rule out within the UK.3\nThe first part of this article ask when , if ever , a vaccine should be mandatory .\nThese be thus reason to doubt whether a policy of voluntary vaccination will be good enough , though it remain to be see .\nV-Day ' : A year after COVID-19 pandemic begin in China , UK be first in West to start vaccination\nMore : What vaccination rate in rural America tell u about the advent of COVID-19 vaccine\nIf nurse and other health care professional continue to shy away from the shot , some hospital and clinic say they ’ ll require employee to get vaccinate if they want to keep their job .\nRequiring a COVID-19 vaccination should be no different , legal expert say .\nBut unlike flu shot and other vaccine , the new COVID-19 vaccine aren ’ t likely to become fully approve by the FDA until March or later .\nBy and large , our immunization schedule begin a child , and we have to show proof of vaccination to go to school .\nBut COVID-19 vaccine be brand new , so there will probably be more concerns—even among people who be fully vaccinate against other disease and who have vaccinate their child .\nSo , yes : Once COVID vaccine be available , state could elect to require that people who live within that state be vaccinate .\nStates have the legal and constitutional authority to require that the people who live in that state be vaccinate , or to introduce a vaccine mandate .\nWhen a COVID-19 vaccine become available , some expert think state will require targeted industry to enforce vaccine mandate for their employee , especially those we ’ ve come to know a “ essential worker .\nBut once a vaccine become widely available , will lawmaker leave it up to family to choose to get inoculate or will they require schoolchildren to get a COVID-19 vaccine to attend school ?\nWhile it ’ s common to require child to be vaccinate before attend public school , and important for ensure a safe learning environment , the calculus for mandate a brand new vaccine be different , say Moore of the Immunization Action Coalition .\nBut even if state don ’ t require a COVID-19 vaccine for schoolchildren right off the bat , say Moore and Winnike , that doesn ’ t mean state win ’ t at a late time .\nAs the coronavirus pandemic continue to upend school across the country , many educator , policymakers , parent , and student have stake their hope of return to normal on the development of a vaccine .\nA COVID-19 vaccine for child be still a long way off .\n“ We will learn a lot early on with these vaccine , and eventually when there be ample vaccine for the public , and we have study the vaccine in child , if we find that the vaccine be especially helpful in child , then we will look at whether a requirement will be appropriate for child .\nThere be still important question to be answer about the vaccine , such a how long it will protect people , how effective it will be in child , and whether there might be rare or longer-term side effect that haven ’ t crop up in clinical trial , which begin over the summer .\nAs December start , a member of the New York State Assembly propose a bill to require COVID-19 vaccine for all resident who be able to safely receive it .\nIt remain to be see how the EEOC , which have traditionally be hostile to mandatory vaccination program , will view a COVID-19 vaccine .\nImposition of a mandatory COVID-19 vaccine will almost certainly result in a slew of accommodation requests—medical , religious , personal , and ethical—fueled by mistrust of political leader and the healthcare industry .\nAn August 2020 study find that one-third of Americans would refuse a COVID-19 vaccine , even if one be available .\n`` While step have be take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 , epidemiologist and public health expert have conclude that a vaccine will be necessary to develop herd immunity and ultimately stop the spread of the disease , '' the bill 's support memo state .\nChildhood vaccine , for example , be require to attend school ( they do allow various exception , however , depend on the state ) .\nACIP would have to recommend the vaccine for all adult and child base on ample evidence that it be safe and effective , beyond the FDA ’ s approval or emergency authorization of a Covid-19 vaccine .\nThe New York State Bar Association on Saturday pass a resolution urge the state to consider make it mandatory for all New Yorkers to undergo COVID-19 vaccination when a vaccine become available , even if people object to it for “ religious , philosophical or personal reason .\nThey include that the state government should only consider make vaccination mandatory if voluntary COVID-19 vaccination fall short of produce needed level of population immunity .\n” At present , no law , regulation , or other guidance directly address whether employer may require their employee to get a COVID-19 vaccination .\n” Notably , the CDC have issue guidance recommend influenza vaccination for critical industry during a pandemic.5 It be likely that the EEOC will issue updated guidance to address the issue of COVID-19 vaccination in the workplace in the near future .\nGiven the fast-evolving nature of the situation , it be crucial for employer to monitor new law and guidance from federal and state authority so it can plan accordingly once a COVID-19 vaccine become generally available in the United States .\nEmployers may be able to require employee to get a COVID-19 vaccine , but be it the right thing to do ?\nFurthermore , this FDA committee raise specific concern regard pediatric vaccination with unproven COVID-19 vaccine , for a population generally unaffected by this new disease .\nNew York ’ s recommendation contrast with the U.S. FDA 's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee recommendation on October 22 , 2020 , which oppose mandatory vaccination policy since the initial COVID-19 vaccine be consider 'experimental ' without proven vaccine efficacy .\nFor many employee ,

Wade .\nThe law specify that a “ health care practitioner license , certify , or authorize ” under New York ’ s medical license law can perform an abortion and make the professional judgment describe above .\nLast week , on the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision , New York state enact a new abortion law , call the Reproductive Health Act .\nThe new law allow abortion under any of three condition : ( 1 ) if it be perform early than 24 week of pregnancy ; ( 2 ) in an “ absence of fetal viability ” ; or ( 3 ) if necessary to “ protect the patient ’ s life or health .\n” New York State Right to Life , a state political party and lobbying group , argue that this language open the door to “ restrict effort by pro-lifers…and prohibit any limit on abortion .\n, if Roe v. Wade have be overrule by the Supreme Court , New York would have revert to it 1970 abortion law , which already permit abortion for any reason up to the 24th week of pregnancy and later than that in case of danger to the mother ’ s life .\nAfter the removal of abortion from the penal code , the exist definition of person a “ a human be who have be bear and be alive ” remains—but because there be no longer any reference whatsoever to unborn child a possible victim of homicide , the law now effectively exclude them from the definition of “ human person .\nThe primary reason for it passage be to stake out New York ’ s position in favor both of preserving and expand Roe v. Wade ’ s guarantee of access to abortion .\nAnd the way the law accomplish that be to remove anything in New York law that could have be interpret to limit abortion or to extend any protection to a child before birth .\nPrior to these change , the definition of homicide include cause the death of a person ( define a “ a human be who have be bear and be alive ” ) or of an unborn child if the woman have be pregnant for more than 24 week .\nalso modify section of the New York state penal code to eliminate reference to abortion .\nThat be not just because New York protect the right to abortion .\nThe new law do not contain any meaningful restriction that be likely to ever prevent an abortion .\nThe big tragedy be that it more deeply entrench our division over abortion by adopt the most absolutist pro-choice position imaginable and leave New Yorkers less able to work together to address or even acknowledge the factor that contribute to our state ’ s catastrophically high abortion rate .\nPro-life leader in New York argue , and I make this same case on HOPE ’ s podcast a couple of week ago , that remove abortion from the criminal code would not , in fact , empower woman , but , instead , would empower abuser .\nNew York , the most recent state to move in this direction , pass the Reproductive Health Act ( RHA ) on January 22nd .\nOn Jan. 22 , tragically , New York state ’ s new abortion expansion bill , the Reproductive Health Act , be pass by Democratic majority in the Assembly and Senate and sign into law by Governor Cuomo .\nThe newly enact Reproductive Health Act expand on what ’ s legal after 24 week , allow a woman to get an abortion after 24 week if her health be threaten , not just her life , and if the fetus would be unable to survive outside the womb .\nThe new law also move abortion regulation from the state ’ s criminal code to the health code , thereby remove the threat of criminal prosecution for medical professional who perform abortion .\nBut abortion right advocate point out that the new law bring state policy in line with legal precedent establish by Roe , and the idea that the law allow any woman with a healthy , risk-free pregnancy to have an abortion “ through birth ” in the third trimester be flaw .\nAnti-abortion activist have say the New York law be an extreme step that go too far in expand access to abortion later in pregnancy , argue that legalize abortion for woman whose health be at risk — a broad category than the prior law — give doctor too much discretion .\n”\nThe New York law come at a time when advocate on both side of the abortion debate be prepare for the possibility that Roe v. Wade — the landmark 1973 case that effectively legalize abortion nationwide — could be overturn by the U.S. Supreme Court , intensify the focus on state abortion law .\nBut New York ’ s law be the late of what be expect to be a wave of abortion legislation in coming year .\nHere ’ s what to know about the new law :\nUnder New York ’ s previous law , which have be in place since 1970 , abortion be legal during the first 24 week of pregnancy .\n“ It ’ s for people after 24 week who find themselves with either bad pregnancy indication for the fetus or threat to their own health .\n“ This radical expansion of abortion on demand through birth be a tragedy to be mourn , not a victory to be celebrate , ” Marjorie Dannenfelser , the president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List , say in a statement .\nUnder the RHA , any health care practitioner be permit to perform an abortion—using his or her “ professional judgment ” if “ the patient be within twenty-four week from the commencement of pregnancy , or there be an absence of fetal viability , or the abortion be necessary to protect the patient ’ s life or health .\nThe new Reproductive Health Act ( RHA ) go further , decriminalize abortion in New York and treat it a a matter of public health .\nIn 1970 , three year before the Supreme Court ’ s Roe v. Wade ruling , New York State pass a measure legalize abortion in the first two trimester , but outlaw abortion in the third , except to save the life of the mother .\nIt also bring New York in line with Roe by allow abortion after 24 week to protect the health of the mother , which be never part of the 1970 New York law .\nThe Reproductive Health Act legalize abortion past 24 week of pregnancy if the woman ’ s health or life be at risk , or if the fetus be not viable .\nWhen New York State ’ s 1970 abortion law be enact , the only medical provider recognize in state law be physician ; therefore , physician be the only medical practitioner authorize to provide abortion care .\nNew York State Civil Rights law and several federal law allow for religious refusal to provide abortion care .\nWhile abortion be cover by the Medicaid health programme in New York , she say people `` hit a funding wall '' beyond 24 week .\nThe Reproductive Health Act ( RHA ) have be see by some a a necessary move to safeguard abortion right should the Supreme Court overturn the ruling , know a Roe v Wade .\nThe act remove the need for a doctor to perform some abortion and take abortion out of the criminal code , make it a public health issue .\nMs Christensen tell the BBC that she `` do n't know about the law '' ban abortion in New York beyond 24 week .\nMs Fadden be also concern that the RHA make abortion a `` fundamental right '' for woman in New York , and will lead to `` pro-life viewpoint suppression '' .\nMs Hoffman describe New York in the early 1970s a an `` oasis '' for woman seek abortion before Roe v Wade , and see a parallel with the state 's decision to implement the RHA .\nOn the 46th anniversary of the landmark US ruling that make abortion legal , New York state sign into law a new abortion right bill .\nPreviously New York do not allow woman to have abortion after 24 week unless their life be in danger ; doctor face up to seven year in prison for perform third-trimester abortion otherwise .\n”\nGiven CDC finding that murder be the second most common cause of death in pregnant woman , all citizen should be concern about the fact that abortion legislation like RHA remove vital protection for victim of assault .",

house , David decide that he have “ too much radioactive stuff in one place ” and begin to disassemble the reactor .\nTo earn it he make a draw show how nuclear fission occur , visit a hospital radiology unit to learn about the medical us of radioisotope\nand build a model reactor use a juice can , coat hanger , soda straw , kitchen match , and rubber band .\nBut although Minnaar ’ s troop didn ’ t know it at the time , they conduct their survey long after David ’ s mother , alert by Ken and Kathy and petrify that the government would take her home away a a result of her son ’ s experiment , have ransack the shed and discard most of what she find , include his neutron gun , the radium , pellet of thorium that be far more radioactive than what the health official find , and
