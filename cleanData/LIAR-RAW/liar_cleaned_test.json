of alcohol within 5 or 10 minute can prove fatal , whereas smoking or eat marijuana might require something like 1,000 time the usual dose to cause death .\nMy surmise be that smoke marijuana be more

expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception .\nHobby Lobby , which say closely hold corporation be not require to provide contraception coverage for their employee .\n\u201c It be very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health-care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception .\nAsis widely know , Hobby Lobby already cover the entire cost of 16 out of 20 FDA-approved contraceptive under it insurance plan for employee .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception .\nSo to introduce this element into our society \u2026 it \u2019 s very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception , \u201d she say .\nSupreme Court rule Monday that the Affordable Care Act can not force closely hold company to cover contraceptive in employee insurance plan if the corporation owner have religious objection to birth control .\nAnd she argue that the Hobby Lobby decision be a setback for woman \u2019 s right , and at one point call it a step toward a \u201c really bad slippery slope , \u201d note that some employer don \u2019 t believe in , for example , blood transfusion .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception , \u201d Clinton say .\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday call the Supreme Court 's ruling that employer with religious objection can refuse to pay for insurance coverage for contraception `` deeply disturb .\nSo to introduce this element into our society it very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer health care plan because her employer doesnt think she should be use contraception .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very trouble that a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health-care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception .\n\u201d She add that corporation could now object to \u201c health coverage of vaccine , or pay the minimum wage , or accord woman equal pay for substantially similar work .\nThe exemption seek by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga woulddeny legion of woman who do not hold their employer belief access to contraceptive coverage , Ginsburg write .\nWhile some woman be able to choose their place of employment take health care into consideration , because of geography and economic restriction , thats not possible for all woman .\nThe fallout from today rule could be that some woman who work company that refuse to cover the IUD may be discourage from use this effective birth control method by additional cost they may incur or the complication of find supplemental insurance .\nWomens right group say restrict insurance coverage for some type of contraception , or make coverage more difficult to obtain , undermines access to birth control in general and point to study that have show that offer great access to contraceptionrather than restrict itleads to fewer unintended pregnancy and thus reduce the number of abortion by 75 percent annually .\nThe court 's majority say that the for-profit company that file suit \u2014 Hobby Lobby Stores , a nationwide chain of 500 art and craft store , and Conestoga Wood Specialties , a maker of custom cabinet \u2014 do n't have to offer female employee all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive a part of a package of preventive service that must be cover without copays or deductible under the law .\nThe day after the Supreme Court \u2019 s Hobby Lobby decision , the court vacate a decision by an appeal court that have rule against a Michigan company that object to provide any contraceptive under it employee health plan .\nUnder the ACA \u2019 s contraception mandate , the owner of Hobby Lobby be force into a dilemma .\n\u201d In it Hobby Lobby ruling , the high court find that the government have fail to demonstrate that the ACA \u2019 s contraception mandate be the least restrictive mean ( mean least burdensome to religious practice ) of achieve it goal of provide cost-free access to female employee to the full range of contraceptive method .\nIf a corporation instead choose not to offer any healthcare plan to employee , the corporation be charge a 2,000 dollar fine each year for each employee it fail to insure .\nAccording to the Greens , the contraceptive mandate interfere with their corporation \u2019 s right to exercise their religious belief by force their employer-provided health plan to cover four FDA-approved contraceptive method that they consider to induce abortion .\nThe ACA , Alito argue , violate Hobby Lobby \u2019 s right under RFRA by compel Hobby Lobby to provide certain contraception method that burden the corporation \u2019 s religious belief , but fail to do so in the least restrictive manner .\nAccording to Alito , the government could have propose other mean of guarantee woman access to the four debate method of contraception without require employer to provide them through employee health plan .\n\u201c It be very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s healthcare plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception , \u201d Clinton say .\nsay that force company like Hobby Lobby to arrange for insurance coverage that cover those form of contraception \u201c demand that they engage in conduct that seriously violate their religious belief .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very trouble that a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception , \u201d Clinton say .\nContrary to Clinton \u2019 s claim , Hobby Lobby \u2019 s website say the company do in fact support the other 16 form of contraception .\nSo Clinton go too far when she say the salesclerk \u201c be not go to get \u201d contraception through the company \u2019 s health care plan .\nAnd the fact that the company pay for 16 type undercut Clinton \u2019 s claim that Hobby Lobby \u201c doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception .\n\u201d Where Clinton \u2019 s claim include a grain of truth be that the salesclerk will not have an unfettered choice in what form of contraception she get .\nAn IUD might be a good alternative , but it would not be available to her under Hobby Lobby \u2019 s health care plan .\n\u201c To the extent she be talk about Hobby Lobby a an employer specifically , I think Clinton overstate her case , \u201d say I .\nHe add , \u201c It may be true for a subset of employee , and to the extent she be also refer to other potential employer who might ban all contraceptive , I think she be on firm ground .\n\u201d Our rule Clinton say that \u201c a salesclerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception \u2026 be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception .\nHobby Lobby doesn \u2019 t shun contraception entirely for it employee ; it pay for access to 16 out of the FDA \u2019 s 20 approve method .\nWhere Clinton have a partial point be that an employee would be bar from have the company pay for four other type , even if one of those may be the best medical option for the employee \u2019 s need .\nIt would deny legion of woman who do not hold their employer \u2019 beliefs access to contraceptive coverage that the ACA would otherwise secure .\n\u2018 Deeply Disturbing \u2019 SCOTUS Decision \u2018 It \u2019 s very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception \u2019 Hillary Clinton on Hobby Lobby .\nIts very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer health care plan because her employer doesnt think she should be use contraception , she say , accord to POLITICO .\n`` I find it deeply disturb that we be go in that direction , `` Clinton say , in reference to the court 's hold that certain corporation have religious right that could allow them to refuse to provide their employee with birth control .\n\u201c It be very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s healthcare plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception , `` Clinton continue .\nHobby Lobby \u2019 s owner , and the owner of other business that support them , weren \u2019 t seek to deprive their 13,000 employee of all contraception coverage in their health plan , just certain kind that they have religious and moral objection to .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception .\nShe make it seem that contraception be affordable only to non-rich people like her and that Hobby Lobby be seek to deny it employee all contraception coverage .\n\u201d They \u2019 re accuse Hobby Lobby \u2019 s owner of want to force their religious belief on woman , yet Democrats think it \u2019 s perfectly moral and just to use government to force their non-religious belief on the owner .\nThe reality of the Hobby Lobby ruling be that no one be tell woman they can \u2019 t get contraceptive .\nHobby Lobby be concern about the health of all of it employee , which be why all of Hobby Lobby \u2019 s full-time employee be offer a generous benefit plan that include coverage for most contraceptive along with an on-site clinic with no co-pay at company headquarters , medical , dental , prescription drug , long-term disability , and other benefit .\nHobby Lobby do pay for most contraceptive under it plan .\nPelosi incorrectly state that the Hobby Lobby decision would prohibit a woman from use a diaphragm .\n\u201c It be very trouble that a sale clerk at Hobby Lobby who need contraception , which be pretty expensive , be not go to get that service through her employer \u2019 s health care plan because her employer doesn \u2019 t think she should be use contraception .\nHillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi have publicly criticize the Hobby Lobby decision a patronize to woman , issue false and largely-misinformed statement on the effect of the ruling , even question whether or not contraception will remain legal .\nHobby Lobby , which allow a closely hold , for-profit corporation to claim a religious exemption from the Affordable Care Act \u2019 s contraception coverage mandate .\nThe branch manager do not act a they do because of any deep-seated objection of their own to the use of emergency contraception ( at least a far a I can ascertain ) .",

    "evidence": "If Donald Trump doesn \u2019 t effectively clinch the Republican nomination by the June 7 end of the primary season , political hell may break loose lead up to a contested GOP convention .\nAP Photo Continue to article content All four early appointee to the rule committee for this year \u2019 s Republican National Convention tell POLITICO they \u2019 re prepare to weaken or scrap a rule that could limit the convention \u2019 s alternative to Donald Trump .\nIf preserve , the rule could block John Kasich or Ted Cruz from compete with Trump at the convention , set for July in Cleveland .\n\u201d If Trump doesn \u2019 t effectively clinch the Republican nomination by the June 7 end of the primary season , the rule committee be destine to be the epicenter of political wrangling and horse-trading lead up to what would be the first contest convention since 1976 .\nThough the panel be imbue with virtually unchecked power to draft rule that tip the nomination away from Trump \u2014 or into his grasp \u2014 most of the panelist and prospective member indicate their action would be guide by a different principle .\nTrump have already grouse about Cruz \u2019 s effort to elect his supporter a delegate to the national convention , a dynamic that could create challenge for Trump on the rule committee , as well a on the floor of the convention , if he \u2019 s unable to secure the nomination beforehand .\nCurrently , delegate be bind to vote on a first ballot accord to the result of the contest in their state .\nAnti-Trump force have unsuccessfully seek to make rule change that would have unbound delegate and allow them to \u201c vote their conscience .\nFrom the first ballot on , the concept go , delegate simply pick anyone they want to be the Republican nominee .\nBased on result from caucus and primary , delegate be bind to vote for certain candidate on the first ballot .\nThat lobbying have Trump accuse the GOP and Cruz of try to steal the nomination from him , even go a far a to suggest \u201c riot \u201d if he \u2019 s not the pick after a brokered convention .\nFacing an organize effort by rival candidate to game state selection rule and undermine his delegate haul , the Republican front-runner be threaten to sue for vote ahead of a potentially contest convention , a move that could foreshadow a new phase in the GOPs ugly primary fight .\nIn Trumps case , it could be argue that the state party rule have be set for month and the national party rule for more than a year , and he only file suit after he fail to secure his delegate .\nBecause delegate from the contest be allocate proportionally under state party rule , Trump and Cruz each secure 18 delegate .\nVirtually all Republican primary allocate delegate on a \u201c winner-take-all \u201d basis , so that the candidate who win the most vote in a state be award all the delegate of that state .\nWould it be `` totally illegal `` for delegate pledge to Donald Trump to vote for another candidate at the Republican National Convention ? .\nWould it be `` totally illegal `` for delegate pledge to Donald Trump to vote for another candidate at the Republican National Convention ? .\nnavigation , search June 17 , 2016 By Paul Brennan Donald Trump may be the presumptive presidential nominee of the Republican Party , but some Republicans still want to stop him from receive the party \u2019 s nomination .\n\u00a7 1-15A-3 Delegates pledge to a certain presidential candidate sign a pledge committing to vote for him or her on the first ballot at the national convention .\n7 Conclusion In response to medium report that some disaffected Republicans want to use the rule of the Republican National Convention to deny him the party \u2019 s presidential nomination by add a `` conscience clause `` that would allow delegate to vote for a candidate other than the one they be pledge to , Donald Trump issue a statement say to do so would be \u201c totally illegal .\nBut give his clear win in the primary , such a move would violate election law , Trump say on NBC 's Meet the Press when ask if convention delegate could stop him .\nTrump have a point that it would be against the current rule , but those rule wo n't necessarily govern this year 's convention .\nAfter all , Trump do secure the majority of delegate , and some state law do commit their delegate .\nBut Putnam and others say it 's unlikely the court will decide in Trump 's favor , give how they 've rule in the past .\nThere have be a well meaning , but misguide , effort to convince delegate to the Republican National Convention that , despite state party rule or state law in many state that bind them to vote for the winner of their state \u2019 s primary or caucus , they be free to vote for whoever they want for President , contrary to these bind requirement .\n\u201d Unquestionably , political party be private political organization that be exercise their First Amendment of right of association when they adopt rule govern their own internal affair , i .\n\u201d So a long a state law or a state party rule bind a delegate to vote for a certain candidate , his or her delegate vote will be so recorded , regardless of the delegate \u2019 s preference , or a Mr .\nIf the Republican Party wish to bind delegate to Trump , it will have to change the rule to do so .\nIn an interview with Chris Hayes on MSNBC after the New Hampshire primary , Sanders say that it would be \u201c divisive \u201d if the convention fail to nominate the delegate leader after the primary , even if that candidate do not have a majority .\nThat have set off a fierce scramble by Republican candidate to get their supporter choose a convention delegate and bring new scrutiny to the selection rule , which vary by state .\nIn February , he issue a blistering press release say that , while he be vote to acquit Trump during his impeachment trial for allegedly instigate the 6 Capitol attack , he condemn the then-president 's unwillingness to accept his election loss and call his language `` extreme , aggressive and irresponsible `` .\nDelegates be award by the Republican Party in each state , and each state have different rule for distribute them .\nThe state chairman and two district-level committee member from each state be automatically seat at the Republican National Convention , but they be oblige to vote for their state 's popular vote winner under the rule of the party branch to which they belong .\nUnder these rule , superdelegates can not vote on the first presidential nominating ballot , unless a candidate via the outcome of primary and caucus already have gain enough vote ( more than 50 % of all delegate vote ) among only the elect pledge delegate .\nMost say a contested convention be legitimate when no candidate have a delegate majority , but they disagree about whether there be an concerted effort to use this year \u2019 s convention to stop Trump .\nDemocracy Is 'Not the Way We Do It ' Some Rules Committee member worry about an effort to shape the rule in order to stop Trump .\n\u201c Maybe the delegate that vote for Trump can now change their mind \u2014 a lot have happen , \u201d she say , \u201c it \u2019 s really delegate will elect the candidate .\nSeveral member of the Rules Committee say it be not accurate to suggest this year \u2019 s approach be any different in response to Trump \u2019 s candidacy .\nWhether this year \u2019 s convention allow vote for vote leader like Trump and Cruz , or also John Kasich and others , depend on the rule set for the convention .\nDonald Trump have be stoke that concern , darkly predict `` you \u2019 d have riot `` if he somehow lose the nomination at the convention .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t change the rule three-quarters of the way into game \u2014 that \u2019 s not fair , \u201d say another Rules Committee member .\nThis insider , who back Cruz , argue that only he and Trump should be on the convention ballot , since that be the basic choice face the party .\n\u201d If Rule 40 be apply , Trump be the only candidate who would currently qualify for a convention ballot right now \u2014 candidate need to have a majority of delegate in eight state .\nBy fail to adjust the rule before the primary begin , he warn , the RNC have now open itself up to a situation where \u201c every propose rule change will be evaluate by the effect it would have on the respective candidate \u201d \u2014 not it logic or fairness .\nBeyond the `` Anybody but Trump `` fight , the committee will set rule for how the party will pick it leader , how it will elect it next presidential nominee in 2020 and how many delegate be award to each state .\nJim Watson/AFP/Getty Images Some member of the Republican National Committee and grassroots Republicans be back an effort to block potential primary challenger to President Trump , even though party insider be insist it be too late to change the rule for the 2020 campaign .\nThe 2012 GOP nominee also say he would not run himself in 2020 and decline to endorse Trump , in an interview with CNN .\nPolitics Romney Promises To Speak Out Against Trump On Matters Of 'Significance ' Responding to the Romney op-ed , Republican National Committee member Jevon Williams call for a change in RNC rule to prevent a costly primary challenge , which he deem a `` fantasy `` that would weaken Trump 's re-election prospect .\nThe proposal to change the party 's rule in order to block a Trump challenger be unlikely to succeed .\nRepublican Party rule expert say that it 's too late to change the rule for the 2020 presidential nomination process .\nGiven it history , it not so farfetched to imagine the rule committee make a last-minute change that dramatically alter the contour of the nomination fight shortly before delegate convene in Cleveland .\nWith the Republican National Convention less than four week away , Trump \u2019 s nomination would seem inevitable , but it isn \u2019 t .\nBut the most sweeping provision would say that , regardless of any other law , the Legislature retain ultimate authority in decide who the state \u2019 s presidential elector be .\nPatrick Semansky\u2014AP Facing harsh criticism from front-runner Donald Trump , the Republican National Committee have all-but cease effort to update the rule that govern the upcoming convention in preparation for the first potential contest gathering in more than a generation .\nBut RNC Chairman Reince Priebus issue the equivalent of a stop work order to the RNCs rule committee on effort to even tweak the rule in light of Trumps recent charge that the establishment be rig the nomination .\nIn response , Trump criticize the delegate selection process a undemocratic and say the RNC will face a rough July if he deny the nomination .\nAsh intend for the committee to consider an amendment to the party rule to prevent the reopening of nomination on the convention floorthe pathway to the nomination of a white knight in the event of a deadlocked convention .\nThat amendment would have shift the convention procedural rule from the rule of the House of Representativeswhich have be in place for generationsto the stricter Roberts Rules of Order , thereby weaken the convention chairman in a move view a weaken the party establishment control over the convention .\nPledged delegate be generally require to vote for a specific candidate in the first ballot\u2014unpledged be not\u2014but they may be allow to vote for any candidate in subsequent ballot .\nhow Trump could be deny the nomination even with a majority It 's that time again \u2014 Donald Trump be at the center of a firestorm , and some GOP elite be speculate about block his nomination , accord to a new report by Jon Ward of Yahoo .\nTo block Trump , a majority of delegate at the convention would simply have to vote to change their rule , to free themselves up to vote for whichever candidate they want .\nBy the current rule of the party , about 95 percent of delegate will go to the convention `` bound `` to cast their ballot for a particular presidential candidate .\nThough bound to vote for Trump on the first ballot , these people could in fact hope to deny him the nomination .\nTed Kennedy try ( and fail ) to get the Democratic nomination with this strategy in 1980 This may sound like a far-fetched scenario \u2014 but Ted Kennedy make a serious attempt to get Democratic delegate to do just this in 1980 , a Elaine Kamarck describe in her book Primary Politics .\nAnd how many delegate overall will be truly hell-bent on stop Trump , versus willing to tolerate his nomination ? .\nThey also know that change the rule to depose Trump would likely make for a chaotic and potentially disastrous mess of a convention , and a new schism in their party .",

be a strong indicator that the initial seller or purchaser may have be engage in unlawful activity .\nAnother large source of gun use in crime be unlicensed street dealer who either get their gun through illegal transaction with licensed dealer , straw purchase , or from gun theft .\n`` In fact , more than half the arrestees say it be easy to obtain gun illegally , `` the report state .\nData

legal gun be also use to commit crime , e .\nAnother investigation reveal that about 1,300 gun take from gun dealer each year may have be steal from or lose by ship company while in transit from gun manufacturer to the gun dealer .\nResearch suggest that steal gun be link to crime \u2014 in fact , many gun find at crime scene can be trace through the underground market .\nOne study find that mandatory-reporting law for lose and steal gun be associate with a 30 percent low risk that gun would be purchase in that state and recover after a crime in another state .\nGiven that a large proportion of steal gun be trace back to a small number of gun dealer , lawmaker should hold those dealer accountable .\nGun traffic be the process by which gun enter the black market and end up be use in crime , while straw purchasing be a tactic where a person buy a gun on behalf of someone else , who be usually ineligible to purchase it .\nBackground \u201c Gun traffic \u201d refers to the diversion of gun from lawful commerce into the illegal market .\nImportantly , when retail seller of firearm be hold accountable for bad business practice , often after undercover investigation by law enforcement , the flow of new gun into the illicit market often decrease significantly .\nGuns purchase from unlicensed seller be also an important source of gun divert to the illegal market .\nResearch also indicate that gun theft and bulk gun purchase be important pathway through which gun be traffic .\nState Laws that Prevent Transfers to Traffickers Apart from the law mention above , the strong law against firearm traffic prohibit the sale or transfer of a firearm if the seller have knowledge or reason to believe the buyer intend to subsequently transfer or resell the firearm to a third party without a background check .\nFor this reason , there be no single profile that can reliably predict who will use a gun in a violent act .\nRisk for gun violence involve similar risk process , although the complexity and variability of individual mean there be no meaningful profile that allow reliable prediction of who will eventually engage in gun violence .\nAdditionally , in the case of an illegal exchange , the law place more accountability on the gun purchaser than the gun seller .\nAlthough the assailant have previously be investigate by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for his link to terrorist organization , he be able to purchase the firearm use in the attack legally .\nThe vast majority of crime gun be handgun possess by adult who be not the original purchaser of the firearm , the report say .\nCurrent federal law require keep record of a firearm 's initial sale with the ATF , but without a way to track subsequent sale , trace the full path of a weapon use in a crime remain difficult .\nThough there have be a push for federal gun regulation in recent year , the power to legislate gun sale and gun ownership be largely beholden to the state .\nIts often a topic of debate if people be the problem or gun themselves but this study meet at the intersection of these stance to say it the law that allow for certain people to acquire gun that be the problem .\n`` When this many crime gun be trace back to a single dealer , it raise serious question about how that dealer do business , and in this case you don \u2019 t have to look far for the answer .\nWe know that an effective violent crime reduction strategy must also address the illegal trafficking of firearm and focus on keep gun out of the wrong hand .\nAnd if they do , then local and federal law enforcement can better coordinate to trace illegal gun sale back to the shady gun dealer and hold them accountable .\ninvolve and may disguise the illegal transaction by falsify the paper record of sale or report the gun a steal .\nWe do not know whether this be drive by difference in the quality of the gun purchase or in the cost of distribution in the two sector .\nTrace data , reflect firearm recover by police and other law enforcement agency , have reveal that a noteworthy proportion of gun have a time to crime ( the length of time from the first retail sale to recovery by the police ) of a few month or a few year .\nInterstate trafficking of firearm flourish , in part , because state regulate sale differently , and there be no federal limit on the number of gun an individual may purchase at any one time .\nA study of crime gun recovery in Baltimore find that gun purchase in multiple sale be significantly more likely than gun purchase in single sale to be recover from a possessor who be not the original buyer .\nEven if your dad give you a gun , he have to make sure you have a firearm license and that the transfer of the gun be record in the state database \u2014 or seriously risk legal trouble of his own , since police may notice he \u2019 s not in possession of a firearm the database indicate he own .\n\u201c It \u2019 s another opportunity for law enforcement to identify individual who might be too risky to have gun , \u201d he say .\nOften , he say , police find traffic gun only after they be use in a crime .\n\u201d Any gun can become a crime gun \u2014 it just have to be use in a crime .\nSince ATF trace only to the first retail sale , it can \u2019 t see if someone buy a preowned gun at a pawnshop and then use it in a crime the

    "evidence": "The Bush Tax Cuts Are the Disaster that Keeps on Giving Debt Would Be at Sustainable Levels Without Them The 10-year-old Bush tax cut be clearly an economic failure that have make our country fiscally weak , write Michael Linden and Michael Ettlinger .\nBut rather than follow President Bill Clintons successful lead , President Bush hand out gigantic tax cut , with people at the top of the income ladder get the big break .\nBut even with all of that , when one add back the foregone revenue from the Bush tax cut to the actual revenue collection over the past 10 year , the debt picture suddenly become markedly well .\nSimilarly , in a future without the Bush tax cut , the national debt would be under control .\nIn large part , thats because the CBO baseline assume the full expiration of the tax cut .\nTo some extent , theres nothing we can do about the disastrous fiscal impact of the Bush tax cut now .\n* Theres no undo the fiscal damage from the Bush tax cut .\nTen year after the first round of Bush tax cut be sign into law , we know with certainty that they be a huge mistake .\nEconomic Impacts of the Bush Tax Cuts The cut have the cumulative effect of add to the debt without significantly boost growth .\n\ufeff\ufeff Drivers of the Bush Tax Cuts Both political and economic reason motivate the Bush tax cut .\nWhen he take office in 2001 amidst a recession , he argue that tax cut would help stimulate the sluggish economy and that the surplus from the Clinton administration could help pay for them .\nThey operate under the belief that all tax cut increase consumer spending enough to make up for the revenue loss .\nBut for the tax cut to have this impact , tax before the cut must be in the `` prohibitive range `` on the curve .\n\ufeff\ufeff Some economist theorize that the recession may have play a role in dampen the potential revenue increase of the tax cut .\nBush publicize his vision for America and central to this be his aggressive tax cut .\nFollowing the boom of the Clinton year and the surplus that be leave in it aftermath , Bush would have the ammunition necessary to convince the nation that tax cut be necessary .\nFinally , this work will discuss the role these cut play in increase the nation debt burden and how this have manage to change many Americans view of government spending , particularly in the confines of the Economic Crisis of 2007-2010 .\nThe recession have allow the reduction of the dividend to be frame a an engine of stabilize , something that the tax reduction be not when it be originally conceptualize .\nAdditionally , the if the popularity boost that tax cut would create could be capitalize upon , this would mean the ability elect more Republican member to Congress and could help speed up the process in which the size of government be reduce or so go the thinking of many Republican fiscal conservatives8 .\nThe second reason for the discrepancy be a reduced tax base a a result of the Bush cut .\nDespite these number and the vast difference in the overall magnitude of their respective recession , the Bush tax cut prove to be incredibly popular while the Obama stimulus bill be pass on strictly party line and be the subject of substantial political backlash .\nBy decrease tax revenue through his tax cut and by his huge increase in government spending a result of the two war abroad and his expansion of Medicare , George Bush transform the budget surplus from the Clinton Administration into remarkable deficit .\nBut this be a temporary illusion unless the tax cut be combine with necessary reduction in spending\u2014a far more difficult but also the more important task .\nTax cut without spending cut be not tax cut ; they be tax deferral .\nTo the extent that taxpayer be forward-looking and can see that deficit require future tax hike , they will forego current consumption in order to save for the inevitable tax increase .\nThe initial slow phase-in and temporary nature of the Bush tax cut make the policy less predictable\u2014and also less potent .\nYou can \u2019 t starve the beast through tax cut if you \u2019 re feed it with borrow fund .\nIt would be a mistake to use the disappointing performance of the Bush tax cut to dismiss decade of economic evidence that demonstrate that low taxation be well for economic growth .\nThe theory behind Trump \u2019 s tax cut be exactly what give u the failed Bush economy - Vox Share All share option for .\nThe theory behind Trump \u2019 s tax cut be exactly what give u the failed Bush economy The last time Republicans obtain unified control of the federal government , after the 2002 midterm , they immediately set out to pass a large tax cut on dividend and capital gain income .\nBut it \u2019 s plain a day that a big cut in corporate tax isn \u2019 t go to help with any of this , and that starve the federal government of fund by enact a big corporate tax cut could hurt on several front .\nMaking the tax cut permanent would have a multiplier effect of 0 .\nThe tax cut make the tax system less progressive .\nToday Obama say that his priority be to `` prevent the middle-class tax increase `` that would have come about if there be no agreement .\nIf the president will endanger America 's fiscal future to avoid a tax increase , what will he give to avoid a government shutdown ? `` .\nIn the end , everybody 's tax would have go up .\nThe tax cut be initiate to provide family with more disposable income in the hope that the additional fund would spur spending and pump money into the economy .\nIn fact , the tax cut be in place for so many year that they begin to feel permanent , and taxpayer and politician raise a major outcry a their expiration date approach .\nThose who want to let the Bush tax cut expire a schedule argue that the government need the extra tax revenue in the face of it massive budget deficit .\nThose who want to extend the Bush tax cut or make them permanent argue that high tax reduce economic growth and stifle entrepreneurship and incentive to work .\nThe Downside of the Bush Tax Cuts The Bush tax cut , couple with the war spending on Iraq , lead to a budget deficit from the reduction in tax revenue receive by the government .\nThe term \u201c tax cut \u201d be use in this report to describe the difference between what household pay ( include what they pay indirectly through the federal corporate tax ) in a give year and what they would pay if Congress have make no change to tax law after 2000 .\nThus in June 1990 Bush admit that any agreement to cut the deficit would require not just spend restraint but also tax increase .\nThe Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 legislated cap on discretionary spending and create constraint know a \u201c pay-as-you-go \u201d ( PAYGO ) rule which essentially say that if Congress want to cut a tax or increase entitlement spend it have to pay for the cost in some other part of the budget .\nOne might wonder why we need more tax cut , give that the Congressional Budget Office just release a study show that tax burden a a share of income for almost all household be the low in 2009 that they have be in decade and give that we face a long-term deficit problem that will require more revenue over time .\nThe answer , of course , be that tax be slat to rise at the end of this year , an increase that if allow in full , along with scheduled spending cut that come out of the debt limit budget deal in 2011 , would hurt an already weakly recover economy in the short-term and possibly push it back into recession , if not counteract .\nThe economy would still be face tax increase ( due to the end of the temporary payroll tax cut ) and government spending cut ( due to the budget deal ) .\nThe four economist also note that to get the full impact of the tax cut , Bush and Congress would need to cut planned spending significantly .\ncut to Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security ) or repeal the Affordable Care Act\u2014through CBO project dump the ACA would add to the deficit , not reduce it .\nBut there be no doubt the plan be a huge tax cut .\n\u201c These reform , these tax cuts\u2014they need to be permanent , \u201d Ryan tell a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers .\nThey need the certainty from permanent tax cut to hire more worker , invest in their business , and plan for the future .\nWithout that tax , however , Republicans would have to find $ 1 trillion somewhere else to pay for reduce rate .\n\u201d The problem with a straight tax cut be the Senate .\nJust because tax cut be temporary doesn \u2019 t mean they go away .\nIn short , the policy choice make on the Bush tax cut be expensive .\nThe projected costliness of the Bush tax cut should not come a a surprise ; they have be expensive since enact .\nThe figure below indicate the role these tax cut play .\nWhile the Bush tax cut be design a overwhelmingly regressive , the most recent deal do add some progressivity to the tax code , by allow the cut to expire on the top 0 .\nBut what be the tax cut ? .\nTax Policy with an Expiration Date The Bush tax cut be always mean to be permanent improvement to the tax code .\nIn other word , if the traditional template for tax reform be broaden the base and low the rate , the 2001 Bush tax cut only focus on the second half of this template .",

    "evidence": "In the past , some teacher organisation have argue that these issue should be leave in the hand of teacher , and that the school performance of student be quite acceptable compare with that of other nation .\nFurther , concern have be express about the academic quality of those accept into education faculty ( Leigh & Ryan , 2006 ) and of the adequacy of the training of teacher receive to enable them to deal with the diverse need of the student population .\nAlternatively , it could be that teacher have a different perspective to that of the rest of the community regard the process through which learning occurs .\nIn any case , there remain a need to address teacher \u2019 and parent \u2019 concern regard classroom practice in a cooperative and constructive manner .\nFor teacher try to provide effective remedial literacy assistance to such pupil , the Matthew effect help explain ( a ) why progress be often painfully slow , ( b ) a lack of significant change in general classroom performance consequent upon improved reading , ( c ) why only present a dedicated phonemic awareness program with old child may not necessarily have a powerful impact .\nWithin this model , teacher be expect to react appropriately to student-initiated direction , rather than expect student to respond to a curriculum present in a preplanned manner .\nThose who do respond send their message privately to the teacher , rather than put them in the group chat for all to see .\nWhile student ca n't really study for standardized test , some teacher provide practice test to help ease student ' worry .\nOur discussion of these case be base on the assumption that what be know about learn applies to teacher as well a to their student .\nOPPORTUNITIES FOR PRACTICING TEACHERS Practicing teacher continue to learn about teach in many way .\nOther example include the Physics Teacher Resource Agent Project of the American Association of Physics Teachers and the Woodrow Wilson Fellows , in which teacher be train to provide workshop in instructional method and material , as well a content , for other teacher ( Van Hise , 1986 ) .\nFor the most part , teacher take graduate course in education rather than in the subject matter of their teaching because of the lack of disciplinary graduate course that be offer after school hour or during the summer .\nBecause of the wide variety of way in which teacher continue to learn about teaching and learning , it be difficult to generalize about or judge the quality of the teacher learn experience .\nThe group can be anything to which the teacher agree , but usually involve issue of student achievement , such a , What be good work ? .\nComing to joint decision require these teacher to wrestle with issue of mathematics and mathematics learn around their own specific problem of practice a teacher , such a what constitute valid evidence for student understand in the specific day-to-day situation .\nWhile our analysis only include result from student who test in-school in the spring , many of these student be learn remotely for meaningful portion of the fall and the winter .\nThey can help teacher understand challenge that your student be face outside of the classroom that can be affect their learning .\nTeachers should be aware of preconceived idea about the student in the classroom to guard against bias talk on the part of other student .\nThe intent of the core program be the delivery of a high-quality instructional program in reading or math that have establish know outcome that cut across the skill development of the targeted area .\nThe expectation be that if the Tier 1 program be implement with a high degree of integrity and by highly trained teacher , then most of the student receive this instruction will show outcomes upon assessment that indicate a level of proficiency that meet minimal benchmark for performance in the skill area .\nIn addition , general education teacher train on the delivery of specific instructional program be also periodically assign to Tier 2 .\nMovement Between Tiers As indicate above , another key to an RTI model be the need for periodic meeting when teacher , along with other school professional , review the progress of student receive supplemental instruction .\nTeams of teacher , assist by those who be familiar with data interpretation , make

use Value-added Models ( VAM ) , a way of statistically isolate and analyze a teacher \u2019 s contribution to student learning .\nFor teacher evaluation , a for any type of employee evaluation or performance review , we begin with ( often implicit ) question such a \u201c How effective be this person \u2019 s practice ? .\nbe clear about instructional goal be knowledgeable about curriculum content and the strategy for teach it communicate to their student what be expect of them , and why make expert use of exist instructional material in order to devote more time to practice that enrich

measure of student achievement such a standardized test score or Student Learning Objectives develop by teacher The use of standardized test score , though now quite common , be still somewhat controversial .\nPrincipals may even hear multiple complaint about a teacher from parent , student , and colleague over the course of a school year , but when they enter the classroom to conduct the observation , they find a well-managed class with a perfectly execute lesson in place .\nCouple this with a lack of specific , meaningful and actionable feedback from administrator and it leave teacher feel a if evaluation doesn \u2019 t count for much outside of the summative rating they receive that put their mind at ease ( or perhaps cause undue stress ) until the next cycle .\n\u201d It

) project , a multi-year study fund by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation design to investigate and promote great teaching , conclude that \u201c evaluation system that include both value-added calculation and other factor , include classroom observation and student survey , be the most stable measure of teacher quality .\n\u201d Effective model engender the condition for collaboration among administrator and teacher , and create space for administrator to provide meaningful and actionable feedback for teacher , rather than just a simple summative rating .\n1 ) Provide a more valid measure of teacher quality by distinguish between teacher at different performance level ; 2 ) Recognize strong teacher and keep them in the classroom ; 3 ) Encourage consistently less effective teacher to leave the classroom ; 4 ) Help all teacher improve ; 5 ) Recruit more effective new teacher ; and 6 ) Achieve gain in student learning and other positive student outcome .\nWhen the

talented student be in every school and classroom , few district require that all classroom teacher receive train to address the educational need of advanced learner .\nFor example , with a low

addition to mask wearing .\nMore frequent testing may be need for student , teacher , staff , and adult volunteer who be not fully vaccinate and engage in school athletics and other extracurricular activity .\nA fourth grade boy who be struggle in math show comfort in admit to his teacher that he need help with multiplying and divide fraction even if most of the student in the class have move

they experience positive relationship with their teacher ( Liew , Chen , & Hughes , 2010 ) .\nIn that connection , school need to review their discipline policy to make sure they be not unduly punish student and that staff be train on appropriate way to manage their classroom and implicit bias .\nSeveral school district across the country be exploit vagary in the law to arm teacher , with no state oversight .\nEffects on teacher , school , and school district [ edit ] Increased accountability [ edit ] Supporters of the NCLB claim one of the strong positive point of the bill be the increased accountability that be require of school and teacher .\na student 's progress in reading and math must be measure annually in grade 3 through 8 and at least once during high school via standardized test Provides information for parent by require state and school district to give parent detailed report card on school and district explain the school 's AYP performance ; school must inform parent when their child be teach by a teacher or para-professional who do not meet `` highly qualified `` requirement Establishes the foundation for school and school district to significantly enhance parental involvement and improved administration through the use of the assessment data to drive decision on instruction , curriculum and business practice The commonwealth of Pennsylvania have propose tie teacher 's salary to test score .\n45 Criticisms of standardized test [ edit ] Critics argue that the focus on standardized testing ( all student in a state take the same test under the same condition ) encourage teacher to teach a narrow subset of skill that the school believe increase test performance , rather than achieve in-depth understanding of the overall curriculum .\n49 The teacher correctly anticipate the content of the test , but incorrectly assume each test would present simplistic item rather than higher-order item .\n`` 60 Student performance in other subject ( besides reading and math ) will be measure a a part of overall progress .\n6263 In some school , the class remain available , but individual student who be not proficient in basic skill be send to remedial reading or mathematics class rather than art , sport , or other optional subject .\nAccording to the No Child Left Behind Act , by 2014 , every child be suppose to test on grade level in reading and math .\n79 Variability in student potential and 100 % compliance [ edit ] The act be promote a require 100 % of student ( include disadvantage and special education student ) within a school to reach the same state standard in reading and mathematics by 2014 ; detractor charge that a 100 % goal be unattainable , and critic of the NCLB requirement for `` one high , challenge standard `` claim that some student be simply unable to perform at the give level for their age , no matter how effective the teacher be .\nHave effective teacher for all student , effective principal for all community Accelerate progress and achievement gap close through improve accountability Move beyond status quo to effective school improvement and student option Have fair and accurate assessment of student progress Have high standard for every student in every state Ensure high school prepare student for college and the workplace Drive progress through reliable , accurate data Encourage parental involvement and empowerment The Forum on Educational Accountability ( FEA ) , a work group of signer of the Joint Organizational Statement on NCLB have offer an alternative proposal .\nFrom these study , it have be estimate how much child learn over a school year ( to make the estimate of how far the group \u2019 s average score on skill be at the end of the year from their skill level at the beginning of a year comparable across study , we use standard deviation ) .\nFirst , when educator measure and a child \u2019 s learning , they will need to consider that there be many way that child learn and many type of knowledge that they acquire beyond math and reading .\n23 Shares of teacher who say they have train in the past 12 month on the use of computer for instruction Shares of teacher report usefulness of train they receive in use computer for instruction Notes .\nAt the most basic level , school be try to assess how broadly and consistently student be interact

tax since become governor in 2010 .\nBut while the legislature ignore his call for across-the-board state income tax cut , Christie do sign into law property tax and business tax relief .\nHaving inherit a state on the brink of bankruptcy , Christie cut state spending ; hold the line on tax ; fix the state 's unfunded pension liability ; and take on the vested interest that have so long make Trenton a den of dysfunction .\nBut under Christie , the average net property tax bill have increase by 20 percent , largely because of the governor 's deep cut to the state 's direct rebate program .\nChristie 's plan would do nothing to reduce the aggregate property tax levy , but it would diminish the state 's income tax collection .\nLess money in the state 's coffer mean less money to transfer to town and school district , and less money for property tax rebate .\nYour income tax bill just go down , but your property tax go up to compensate for the loss of state aid .\nPerennially strap for cash , the state have shirk key investment in high education and infrastructure , choose instead to prioritize local property tax relief .\nIn a recent op-ed , a prominent Democratic state senator and gubernatorial aspirant argue that property tax have increase under Christie because the governor cut rebate and municipal aid .\nIf we do not act in a bi-partisan way to renew the arbitration cap , your property tax will skyrocket again .\nBut when Christie \u2019 s rebate reduction be factor in , his property tax record be not so clear-cut .\nBut Christie have repeatedly point to the low percentage growth in property tax during his administration a evidence that the 2 percent cap and other policy change , include pension , health benefit , and bind arbitration reform , be succeed in hold down New Jerseys highest-in-the-nation property tax .\nThe real impact of these policy change be that the property tax burden on the middle class have increase exponentially with the virtual elimination of rebate , say Rousseau , who serve a state treasurer under Corzine .\nThat be because while Christie have cut property tax rebate , the GOP governor leave the income tax credit for the first $ 10,000 of property tax untouched .\nChristie clearly have be deal with a state economy recover slowly from the recession , but cut net property tax have not be his top tax cut priority .\nThen , when Christie felt that his New Jersey Comeback have begin in January 2012 , he do not propose a restoration of direct property tax relief , but call instead for a 10 percent across-the-board state income tax cut that would have cost at least $ 183 million in FY2013 and $ 1 .\nBut New Jerseyans generally give Christie low rating for his handling of property tax than other issue , and it doesnt change the impact that Christies rebate cut have have on middle- and lower-income New Jerseyans .\nColeman suggest that policymakers need to spend less time focus on the particular source of regressiveness in the tax system than on the overall impact .\nInevitably , this trickle down to affect property tax bill because town have to find the money elsewhere .\nPrieto , however , say the issue be the same this year a it be last year when Democratic legislative leader agree to pass the first stage of the tax cut if Christie \u2019 s revenue come in a project by the governor and his treasurer .\nChris Christie than under previous governor , primarily due to a sharp reduction in direct property tax relief over the past two year .\nIn fact , net property tax be 20 percent high under Christie than they be when Democrat Jon Corzine leave office two year ago .\nIn comparison , Christie \u2019 s direct property tax credit cover just 3 percent of last year \u2019 s tax bill .\nThis headline be disingenuous to imply that Governor Christie alone bear responsibility for property tax increase .\nPart of the issue be that when Christie dramatically cut state funding for local school ( in many case by 100 % ) the town have to increase property tax to make up the difference .\nWhile , a some have point out , it be a bit mislead to pin this all on Governor Christie , he certainly deserve his share of the blame that say , there really should be no surprise on anyones part nothing he say he would do a a candidate ( and certainly nothing he actually do ) be ( be ) likely to have any serious impact on our outrageously high property tax .\nWhy do I suspect that , have property tax go down , the governor and his supporter would be happily take the credit .\nChris Christie ( R ) be revive a once-failed income tax plan that will give a 10 percent tax cut to all of the state \u2019 s resident but will grant more of it benefit to the wealthy New Jerseyans .\nChristie approve the pension cut due to low tax revenue in the state , but a group of state and national union sue , cite a 2011 law that fund New Jersey 's pension fully .\nHe have both par back income tax credit for the working poor and reduce or defer subsidy that help lower- and middle-class homeowner cope with the high per caput property tax in the nation .\nChristie \u2019 s

Christies approach on property tax to be a resounding success , but the senior citizen and middle-class homeowner burden by Gov .\nGuadagno , who be Christie 's lieutenant governor , have seek to make property tax a focal point of her campaign by offer a promise to lower them .\nWhen Christie run for his first term in 2009 , he speak broadly about cut spending and tax , but offer few specific

his daughter , Chelsea Clinton ( both be member of the govern board ) , draw any salary or receive any income from the foundation .\nWhen Hillary Clinton be a board member , she reportedly also

\u2019 s image by align it with the former president \u2019 s famous charitable effort \u2014 thereby portray the company a a force for good in the world .\nThere be no evidence Hillary Clinton play a

    "input": "The United States is the only developed country in the world without paid maternity leave.",
    "evidence": "Of people who take unpaid leave in the United States , just over half do so for their own health problem .\nWhile Congress address this need amid the pandemic by provide temporary emergency pay sick leave and emergency pay child care leave to some worker , the United States still lack a permanent and comprehensive pay family and medical leave policy .\nLow-wage worker be less likely to have access to different form of pay leave .\nWhile it benefit reach every worker and family , pay leave be particularly critical for parent .\nAlthough most nation have policy that be far less generous , almost all of them provide some amount of pay leave for new mother , with the majority guarantee at least fourteen week of pay maternity leave .\nThe PDA do not provide time off to care for a new child , however , which mean that many woman still have to leave the workforce after give birth .\nThere be a number of reason that the United States remain the only industrialized country without pay family and medical leave at the national level .\n`` Those contribution to the government may come from employer , employee and the government 's general revenue , but they pay it through a social insurance system , so that no business have a heavy burden \u2014 if they 're a small employer and one person 's out , or if they 're a large employer , but disproportionately have young parent a employee , `` Heymann say .\nMost country do n't offer equal leave to men and woman .\nbe the only developed country without a national paid parental leave policy .\nBut this be unpaid leave , and it do n't apply to about half of the American work force .\nThe downside of the lack of pregnancy leave and benefit in the United States be significant .\nIn fact , it the only developed country in the world that doesnt offer parent some type of pay leave benefit .\ndo not require company to offer worker pay parental leave or maternity leave benefit .\nResearch have show pay parental leave offer inarguable benefit for parent , child and the society of country who provide it .\n\u201c Public poll show that the American people do not want the federal government to fund a pay leave programme , prefer that employer pay for it .\nAs of 2016 , a significant number of top company in the US still didn \u2019 t offer pay parental leave to non-salaried worker , the non-birth parent or adoptive parent .\nThe US be the only develop country that doesn \u2019 t guarantee pay maternity or parental leave to worker .\nBut it \u2019 s little help to the many Americans who can \u2019 t afford to take time off without pay .\nOman , Papua New Guinea and the United States provide some form of maternity leave but have no overall law for cash benefit .\nbe currently the only industrialized country that do not provide pay family leave to it citizen .\nEven this unpaid leave requirement only protect about 60 percent of employee ; it fail to cover independent contractor , employee at company with few than 50 employee , and many other worker .\nbe the only developed country without mandate pay parental leave .\nWe \u2019 re the only developed country without government-mandated pay parental leave , and one of only a handful of nation worldwide that don \u2019 t provide it ( and I \u2019 ll bet you can \u2019 t even point to the others \u2014The Marshall Islands and Papua New Guinea \u2014 on a map ) .\nEmployers be not responsible for provide the wage , though they do have to comply with applicable state payroll law .\nStudies suggest almost half of worker who qualify for unpaid leave but do not take it say they decline take leave because of money , and two-thirds of worker who do take unpaid leave say they experience financial trouble a a result .\nIn many county , maternity leave be pay at the employee 's regular salary , while other country pay only a portion of the regular salary .\nbe the only economically developed country without any federally mandate pay maternity , paternity or parental leave .\ndo not guarantee pay during maternity leave , while some country mandate that mother receive 100 % pay during their entire leave , include Algeria , Denmark , Germany , India , Mexico , Niger , Poland and Ukraine .\nworker have caregiving responsibility for infant and small child , as well a parent and other old relative , which mean the lack of pay family leave at most low- and moderate-income job exacerbate inequality .\nPaid family leave legislation in California , New Jersey , and the District of Columbia do not have any provision for job protection , which require that employer allow worker to return to their preleave job after the leave have end , though eligible worker can simultaneously take job-protected unpaid leave under current federal or state law .\n9 These barrier may be especially high for worker in low-wage job , who be less likely to be eligible for job protection through the current federal unpaid leave law and less likely to be able to afford to take even partially pay leave .\nThese benefit may be especially important for the least advantaged family , in which worker be the least likely to have access to any employer-provided paid leave .\nPresident Biden say in June the United States be the \u201c only industrialize country in the world \u201d that doesn \u2019 t have pay family leave .\nBut there be still many more country that fall short of the standard set by the International Labor Organization , which state a woman should be entitle to at least 14 week of pay family leave upon childbirth .\nSupport for government funding be much low in the United States about half endorsed it for maternity leave , and only a third want it for paternity leave .\nAmericans also didnt want a much pay leave a do those from other country in the survey .\nbe the only major country without pay maternity leave , there be other reason , the researcher say .\nPetts note another reason why political elite in the United States may be less supportive of government-supported leave .\nGiven that the United States be the only industrialized country without a national paid leave mandate , the debate over whether to implement one have grow .\nWhile these protection cover 60 percent of the workforce , evidence suggest that many eligible employee do not take leave when they need it because they can not afford it .\nOf these six program , only Rhode Island , New York and Washington provide job protection that go beyond those provide by the federal FMLA , which mean that in the other three state , employee of small employer might be discourage from take leave a they have no job security guarantee .\nEven the country with the long full-rate equivalent job-protected leave do not offer woman full salary replacement for the total duration of the leave .\nThe United States be shamefully behind regard maternity leave policy .\nOverwhelmingly , however , the issue of pay leave have be boil down to an unacceptable lack of woman in congress ( around 20 % of member be woman ) and sexist bias that perceive woman a less valuable member of the workforce .\nIt be thus argue that pay parental leave , in contrast to unpaid parental leave , be harmful to child 's welfare because in country with an age workforce or country with sub-replacement fertility , child be bear not because the parent want the child and can meet the child 's need but because child be expect to support their parent .\nComparing the length of maternity leave ( which be common in international ranking ) may say very little about the situation of a family in a specific country .\n, while the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ( FMLA ) allow for unpaid parental leave , parent often do not utilize this eligibility to it full extent a it be unaffordable .\n48 A drawback of rise leave at the societal level , however , be the result decrease in female labor supply .\nbe one of the only develop nation that do not require employer to provide any paid leave to new parent .\nSays that the `` United States be the only industrialized , modernized country that do not already have a pay family medical leave program in place .\nThe United States be the only country in the study with no national law to provide that benefit .\nAccording to a 2014 report by the International Labor Organization , an agency of the United Nations , the United States and New Guinea be the only country out of 170 that provide no cash benefit of any kind to woman during maternity leave .\nbe the only industrialized nation that do not `` have a pay family medical leave program in place .\nAll other industrialize nation do have family leave program in place , although some of those plan do not `` guarantee `` all worker be cover .\nOur rule Boysko say , `` The United States be the only industrialized , modernized country that do not already have a pay family medical leave program in place .\nPolitiFact , `` Barack Obama say United States only develop country without pay maternity leave , `` Jan .\nSome individual US state and possession , however , do provide for pay maternity benefit , include Rhode Island , Hawaii , New Jersey , California , New York and Puerto Rico .\n`` Without cash and health benefit , many woman could not afford to take maternity leave , or might be force to return to work before their health allow , `` say Ms .\nIn other country , employer be require to pay all or part of the benefit .\nWhile pay maternity leave have become standard in most industrialized country , progress have not be uniform .\nBut the most common theory be that a program that , however briefly , pay people to not do their job seem to violate the ( sometimes pernicious ) American virtue of self-sufficiency and hard work .\nThis logic , though , can be self-defeating , in the sense that pay leave can help mother stay in the workforce , and it lack can push them out of it .\nOman , Papua New Guinea and the United States provide some form of maternity leave but have no overall law for cash benefit .",

conspiracy theory may serve people \u2019 s desire to be unique , highlight a motivational underpinning of conspiracy belief .\nMore specifically , our general claim be that people with a high need for uniqueness should be more likely to believe in conspiracy theory .\nOverviewIn the current research , we test the overarch hypothesis that the desire to feel unique should foster belief in conspiracy theory .\nThus , in Study 1 , we test whether people who endorse conspiracy theory be more likely to think that they possess scarce and secret information about various conspiracy theory .\nHence , in Study 2 , we test whether people with a high need for uniqueness also believe in conspiracy theory to a large extent .\nOf course , it could be that people believe in conspiracy theory without have information about them .\nStudy 2After establish in Study 1 that belief in conspiracy theory could serve the purpose of feel unique , the goal of Study 2 be to directly test whether people with a chronic high need for uniqueness believe in conspiracy theory to a large extent .\nwithout mention the expression \u201c conspiracy theory .\nResults and DiscussionWe first test our main prediction , that people with a high need for uniqueness should have a high level of belief in conspiracy theory .\nIn line with this hypothesis and with our preliminary work , we find that a high need for uniqueness ( measure by the Self-Attributed Need for Uniqueness scale ) be associate with high belief in conspiracy theory ( measure with the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale ) , r ( 206 ) = .\nThen , we test the relationship between the three underlie factor of need for uniqueness and conspiracy belief ( both linear and quadratic regression ) .\nTo avoid the use of too many statistical test , we combine our two measure of belief in conspiracy theory ( i .\nAmong these test , only one test be significant for this threshold , namely the positive linear relationship between the desire to not always follow rule and belief in conspiracy theory , r ( 206 ) = .\nTheoretically , this effect be consistent with the stereotypical picture of the \u201c out from the crowd \u201d believer in conspiracy theory .\nTo test this hypothesis , after prim need for uniqueness , we measure belief in a ( potentially ) newly form conspiracy theory ( see Bost & Prunier , 2013 ; van Prooijen &

uniqueness should induce a high level of adherence to a conspiracy theory in the individuality condition than in the conformity condition .\nAlthough the effect find in this study be only marginal , it suggest that the tendency to believe in a conspiracy can be influence by the need for uniqueness .\nBelief in a Conspiracy TheoryHowever , another independent sample t-test on the belief in a conspiracy theory measure confirm our prediction that participant in the \u201c different be well \u201d condition have a high level of conspiracy belief ( M = 5 .\nWe again find that participant in the need for uniqueness condition have marginally high level of belief in the conspiracy theory .\nGeneral DiscussionThe purpose of this paper be to empirically test the proposition that conspiracy belief can serve a a mean to satisfy people \u2019 s need for uniqueness .\nIn Study 2 , we use a correlational design to demonstrate that participant with high need for uniqueness believe more in conspiracy theory .\nOur finding can also be connect to recent research demonstrating that individual narcissism , or a grandiose idea of the self , be positively relate to belief in conspiracy theory

believe in conspiracy , \u201d he tell me .\nmock conspiracy theory ( and there be a lot of them around at the moment ) be tempting , but it doesn \u2019 t work .\nConsider these six prevalent conspiracy theory .\nThis conspiracy theory might seem harmless , but it indicate a detachment from verifiable reality that can lead someone to believe anything .\nIt occur to me then that what conspiracy theorists really believe in be an emotional truth about an evil other that wasn \u2019 t affect much by something a messy a specific fact .\nThe first section at the bottom include actual conspiracy that have be prove true ( such a the CIA experiment with drug know a MKUltra ) ; the next , through the \u201c speculation line \u201d , feature area where there be gap in public knowledge ( such a the death of Jeffrey Epstein ) .\n\u201c And if you believe in one conspiracy theory , it \u2019 s a lot easy to believe in more than one .\nAnd if that mean that you don \u2019 t talk about the conspiracy theory at all [ that \u2019 s okay ] .\nDuring time of turmoil , the explanation provide by conspiracy theory and other falsehood can be even more appealing\u2014though not impossible to discourage or resist .\nMany of the conspiracy theory circulate today seek to explain the pandemic itself .\nHer research focus be on belief in conspiracy theory and their consequence .\nThese be n't the only conspiracy theory make inroad right now .\nSo how do conspiracy theory like these get start and why do they persist ? .\nIs there any way to combat conspiracy theory once they 're out there ? .\nWhat count a a conspiracy theory ? .\nI give a few example in the introduction , but how do you define conspiracy theory in your research ? .\nWell , a conspiracy theory can normally be define a a propose plot carry out in secret , usually by a powerful group of people who have some kind of sinister goal .\nBelieving in conspiracy theory and be suspicious about the action of others be in some way quite an adaptive thing to do .\nAnd in term of how we measure the extent to which people believe in conspiracy theory , you can do this in a variety of different way .\nAnd a a social psychologist now , we would normally measure a belief in conspiracy theory by simply ask people question about the extent to which they endorse a particular idea or the extent to which they believe a particular statement be true .\nAnd another way to tap into what some would argue be an underlying tendency to just believe conspiracy theory more generally .\nAnd I guess time will tell if conspiracy theory have I guess , be on the rise in this particular point in time compare to time in the past or time in the future .\nSo it 's really difficult to tell , but it do make sense to me that there would have be particular period in history that conspiracy theory would have be more prominent .\nLet 's talk a little bit about the psychological factor that motivate people to believe in conspiracy theory .\nAnd some psychological evidence suggest that people be draw to conspiracy theory when they do feel uncertain either in specific situation or more generally .\nAnd there be other epistemic reason why people believe in conspiracy theory as well in relation to this sort of need for knowledge and certainty .\nAnd so reach to conspiracy theory might , I guess , at least allow people to feel that they have information that at least explains why they do n't have any control over this situation .\nBut yes , narcissism at an individual level have be associate in quite a few study now with belief in conspiracy theory .\nSo yes , narcissism be one of those individual difference , variable that correlate with belief in conspiracy theory .\nDo you see any association between those and tendency to believe in conspiracy theory ? .\nAnother of your study find that people who believe in one conspiracy theory be more likely to believe in others , even when those theory directly contradict each other .\nObviously we kind of , I guess , start from the point that in the literature it 's often be find that if people believe in one conspiracy theory , then they 're likely to believe in others .\nWe think people would not entertain these two conspiracy theory at the same time , but it turn out that they do , or at least they be prepare to entertain the idea that both of those thing might be true .\nBut we also measure the extent to which people believe in , I guess , an underlying conspiracy theory that something just be n't right .\nAnd what we find be that some people do indeed endorse these contradictory conspiracy theory , or again , at least be likely to entertain those two idea at the same time .\nIt 's very true that some conspiracy theory stand the test of time and others just disappear .\nI think that there must be certain feature of conspiracy theory , the one that last and the one that do n't .\nIs there any way to effectively debunk a conspiracy theory once it 's out there ? .\nHow do you address conspiracy theory ? .\nSo , be there a way for people to balance this awareness with a healthy skepticism of conspiracy theory ? .\nSo , what aspects of conspiracy theory be you look at today ? .\nI 'm really interested in , I guess , the deliberate use of conspiracy theory a a political device .\nSo , I 've be do some research , I guess , look at how people perceive others who seem to use conspiracy theory , and whether or not they see those action a intentional or deliberate , and also what the effect be of that .\nI 've also be interested in the term conspiracy theory itself and the term conspiracy theorist and how people use those term , whether they use them to , I guess , specifically put down other people 's idea , or if they simply use these term when they just do n't believe .\nThis be where narrative and the sense-making function of conspiracy theory come into play .\nMeasures Belief in Conspiracy Theories and Misinformation We develop two index regard belief in conspiracy theory ( e .\nAnalytic Plan As mention above , we develop two measure regard belief in conspiracy theory ; one with three item and another with six item .\nAlthough this corroborate previous finding ( van Prooijen , 2017 ) , our result indicate that misinformation and conspiracy theory be indeed similar , but substantially different , misinformation phenomenon , particularly in term of an individual susceptibility to these belief .\nPartisanship , individual difference , and news medium exposure a predictor of conspiracy belief .\nIntolerance of uncertainty and worldview explanation for belief in conspiracy theory .\nBeliefs in conspiracy theory follow ostracism .\nPutting the stress on conspiracy theory .\nExamining association between psychological stress , anxiety , and belief in conspiracy theory .\nThink of any major world event and there be almost certainly at least one conspiracy theory to explain it .\nOne reason , say psychologist , be that it be perfectly reasonable , because conspiracy sometimes happen .\nNo amount of counter-evidence can refute them , and in fact this evidence often reinforce them because it can be dismiss a part of the conspiracy .\nIn this respect conspiracy theory have much in common with pseudoscience , which superficially resemble science but lack it crucial epistemological feature , falsifiability .\nThe truth be , conspiracy theory be nothing new .\nBut a we saw with the riot on Capitol Hill on January 6 , conspiracy theory aren \u2019 t just unproven ( or disproven ) idea .\n\u201d That doesn \u2019 t mean we should enable conspiracy theory to continue or that people who break the law in the name of these theory shouldn \u2019 t face consequence .\nWhy do people believe conspiracy theory ? .\nThey believe they benefit from the conspiracy theory Do you ever want something to be true so badly ? .\nOther way to handle conspiracy theory in your life Times be uncertain , make the world ripe for the spread of conspiracy theory .\nSoon after , another conspiracy theory take hold .\nSo how do you talk to a person who believe a conspiracy theory ? .\n\u201d Social distance make conspiracy theory more appealing .\n\u201d A kernel of truth , stuff in a conspiracy theory .\n\u201d It \u2019 s repetitive , but it reinforce fact and point out where the conspiracy theory doesn \u2019 t work .\nYou win \u2019 t debunk a conspiracy theory but lay the path for someone in the future to do so .\na tactic that be commonly use in many conspiracy theory .\nFake authorityIf they can \u2019 t present any solid scientific evidence , conspiracy theorist may name impressive-sounding witness who apparently endorse their worldview .\nWhile there may be a nuanced debate over the most effective way to prevent that scenario , these kind of false analogy be use to completely dismiss the need to prevent contagion , allow the conspiracy theorist to assign a more sinister intent for any new measure .\nAnd those two word be \u201c conspiracy theory .\nIt \u2019 s common for people to believe in conspiracy theory .\n\u201c Journalists be say that \u2018 now be the time of conspiracy theory .\nIt \u2019 s not a change that originate from our own susceptibility to conspiracy theory , but appear to be the news medium \u2019 s grow attention on them , a exemplify by this passage from Uscinski \u2019 s 2018 book \u201c Conspiracy Theories and the People Who Believe Them \u201d .\nYet the news medium \u2019 s fascination with conspiracy theory and it regular attempt at debunk them through fact checking may reinforce misplace belief and perpetuate public trust in conspiracy theory .\nBut do correctly , debunk can combat people \u2019 s faith in false conspiracy theory .\nDefining the conspiracy theory People even smart and savvy one mix up conspiracy theory , falsehood and myth .\nA conspiracy and by extension a conspiracy theory must involve a group of people conduct secret deed that disadvantage or infringe on the right of others .\nThe central component of conspiracy theory the difference between them and real conspiracy be proof .\nThis may be hard to fathom , but conspiracy theory be essential to a well-functioning society .\nMany of those event start a conspiracy theory until their underlying evidence be discover and make public .\nThe problem be not that these conspiracy theory exist , but rather that people blindly trust that these assertion be true without evidence .\nThose six element base rate , emotion , consistency , proportionality bias , intentionality bias and pattern search help explain why people believe in conspiracy theory .\nIf the backfire effect exist , then people might forget or ignore the context of a fact check and be leave with a strong belief in a conspiracy theory .\nIndeed , a recent study show a correlation between an individual \u2019 s need for structure and tendency to believe in a conspiracy theory .\nMake friend So if you can \u2019 t rely on the fact how do you get people to bin their conspiracy theory or other irrational idea ? .\nWhile we can argue the merit of analogy or comparison , we should be able to understand how to begin a conversation with denier or believer in conspiracy theory .\n\u201d Ultimately , though , you be unlikely to single-handedly turn someone away from a grand conspiracy theory .\nFor a list of conspiracy theory , see List of conspiracy theory .\n49 A conspiracy theory be an explanation for an event or situation that invoke a conspiracy by sinister and powerful group , often political in motivation,345 when other explanation be more probable .\n8 A conspiracy theory be not the same a a conspiracy ; instead , it refer to a hypothesize conspiracy with specific characteristic , such a an opposition to the mainstream consensus among those people ( such a scientist or historian ) who be qualify to evaluate it accuracy .\nboth evidence against the conspiracy and an absence of evidence for it be re-interpreted a evidence of it truth,812 whereby the conspiracy become a matter of faith rather than something that can be prove or disproven .\nList of conspiracy theory A conspiracy theory may take any matter a it subject , but certain subject attract great interest than others .\n35363738 The general predisposition to believe conspiracy theory cut across partisan and ideological line .\n394041 A broad cross-section of Americans today give credence to at least some conspiracy theory .\na The use of the word 'knowledge ' here suggest way in which conspiracy theory may be consider in relation to legitimate mode of knowing .\nb The relationship between legitimate and illegitimate knowledge , Birchall claim , be close than common dismissal of conspiracy theory contend .\n75 There be also attempt to analyze the theory of conspiracy theory ( conspiracy theory theory ) to ensure that the term `` conspiracy theory `` be use to refer to narrative that have be debunk by expert , rather than a a generalized dismissal .\nThese proponent may not necessarily believe the conspiracy theory , instead use it in an attempt to gain public approval .\nFor example , conspiracy theory be often dependent on eyewitness testimony , despite it unreliability , while disregard objective analysis of the evidence .\nboth evidence against the conspiracy and an absence of evidence for it be re-interpreted a evidence of it truth,812 whereby the conspiracy become a matter of faith rather than something that can be prove or disprove .\nResponses be then assess use a double standard , where fail to provide an immediate response to the satisfaction of the conspiracy theorist will be claim to prove a conspiracy .\n19 More generally , belief in conspiracy theory be associate with hold extreme and uncompromising viewpoint , and may help people in maintain those viewpoint .\nFor example , since conspiracy theory can reinterpret disconfirming information a part of their narrative , refute a claim can result in accidentally reinforce it .\nUnderstanding Conspiracy Theories Social scientist have come to a consensus about what exactly constitute a conspiracy theory .\nConspiracy Theory A conspiracy theory be define a a theory that reject the standard explanation for an event and instead credit a covert group or organization with carry out a secret plot .\nHow Conspiracy Theories Spread There be no evidence that there be currently more conspiracy theory in comparison to other time period .\nExamples of Conspiracy Theories Lets take a look at some example of prominent conspiracy theory in history .\nA conspiracy theory provide an explanation for overwhelm event .\nIt make sense , then , that conspiracy theory be more likely when there be minimal or conflict information about a topic .\n\u201d This be think to be a major appeal of conspiracy .\nThey Spread False Information A conspiracy theory be not just a harmless rumor .\nThe psychology of conspiracy theory .\nThis , he argue , create a bit of common ground and lay the foundation to explore how unproven conspiracy theory differ from reality .\nBecause conspiracy theory become fused with people \u2019 s political and cultural identity , debate a true believer can be counterproductive .\nOne study find that people with this bias be more likely to endorse conspiracy belief than people without it , and it \u2019 s also be find to be correlate with harbor delusion .\nIt \u2019 s not surprise that someone who tend to make up their mind about something after review very little evidence would be more likely to believe in a conspiracy theory .\nMany of the study only observe a correlation \u2014 which we all know do not necessarily equal causation \u2014 between certain trait and conspiracy theory .\nJust because people who believe conspiracy theory be also more likely to have trait X doesn \u2019 t mean that it \u2019 s trait X that \u2019 s make them susceptible \u2014 the two might just go together .\n\u201d Still , this research be useful and help u establish a rich picture of who be susceptible to conspiracy theory .\nRespondents who believe there be some kind of predetermined pattern to the coin toss sequence be more likely to believe conspiracy theory .\nMaking connection between unrelated event or symbol be a key marker of many conspiracy theory .\nBut they demonstrate that conspiracy theorist aren \u2019 t just loony \u2014 many of the trait that can set someone up to believe wild idea be thing all of u be prone to , to some degree .\nJOEY ELLISCognitive quirk only go so far in explain why people believe conspiracy theory .\n\u201d This might help explain why belief in conspiracy theory be surprisingly common .\nThere \u2019 s a good chance you hold a belief that be a conspiracy theory .\nWhen it come to conspiracy theory , the world be not divide into \u201c believer \u201d and \u201c sceptic \u201d .\nMany others might not see themselves a \u201c believer \u201d , but be willing to accept that conspiracy theorist might be onto something and be at least ask the right question .\nAlso , try and find out what specific conspiracy theory they endorse .\nSo when talk about conspiracy theory , start by acknowledge these broad concern and restrict your discussion to whether conspiracy theory can provide an adequate or meaningful answer .\nMany people come to conspiracy theory through genuine , albeit misguide , curiosity about how to make sense of the world .\nThe kernel of truth on which conspiracy theory be base be a solid starting point for a discussion .\nYou may want to point out that throughout history , conspiracy theory have come up short .\nThere be no incontestable argument or fail-proof strategy that will always convert a conspiracy theorist to scepticism .\nAmong the cognitive bias Van Prooijen and other psychologist believe contribute to the appeal of conspiracy theory be .\nYet , there be factor that make some people more or less inclined to accept conspiracy theory .\nBut a few document remain classify , which be more than enough mystery to keep the conspiracy theory around the assassination alive .\n`` I \u2019 ve learn that be there no such thing a evidence that persuade a conspiracy theorist , `` Posner say .\nVan Prooijen also call conspiracy theory a `` form of belief .\n`` It \u2019 s very easy to dismiss evidence a be part of the conspiracy , be part of the coverup .\nSo it \u2019 s very hard to disprove a conspiracy theory .\n\u201d Research into conspiracy theory have find no innate correlation between conspiracy thinking and left-right political orientation .\nSome people be motivate to believe or spread conspiracy theory for partisan reason .\nWhat do it take to be a \u201c conspiracy theorist \u201d ? .\nTo have some level of doubt about one conspiracy theory out there ? .\nOnce we think about conspiracy think on a continuum , there \u2019 s more nuance .\nIf we \u2019 re talk about general level of belief in conspiracy theory , thing probably aren \u2019 t that different today than the past .\nSomething be attractive about conspiracy theory that draw you to them .\nWhat you \u2019 re describing , where it seem like there be many more blatantly partisan conspiracy theory out there \u2014 that \u2019 s probably true .\nAnd you find that Republicans be more likely to believe a conspiracy theory when it be blame on Democrats \u2014 and I should note , the reverse be also true .\nDemocrats be more likely to believe a conspiracy theory when it be pin on Republicans .\nSome of these conspiracy theory be not really emanate from psychological , conspiracy thinking-esque source ; they \u2019 re just partisan mudslinging .\nAnd give his embrace of conspiracy theory before he enter politics , do that suggest that he approach conspiracy theory driven less by partisan motivate reason than by conspiracy thinking ? .\nIf they function a signal \u2014 a way to show allegiance to one side or the other , or to assert your identity \u2014 how do you go about try to correct or combat a conspiracy theory when it \u2019 s tie to something so personal for the person who believe in it , when it seem tie to their identity ? .\nAnd at the same time , if a conspiracy theory have partisan overtone , it \u2019 s almost like people see a correction a have partisan overtone , too .\nThe thing be , if your own ideological identity motivate you to believe a conspiracy theory , you \u2019 re not necessarily an extremist , but you be a partisan , and you probably think of yourself a a liberal or conservative .\nWhat \u2019 s a trusted source for somebody who be literally define by think that everyone and everything be a lie and against them and a conspiracy ? .\nHow do you differentiate between conspiracy theory and misinformation or disinformation ? .\nDefining \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d be tricky .\nMost of u that do this work , you have to sort of believe that truth exists on a continuum to even be able to cobble together a reasonable definition of \u201c conspiracy theory \u201d that do n't accidentally either encompass everything or mean nothing .\nSo , conspiracy thinking , conspiracy theory be sort of a subset of misinformation .\nHow do a conspiracy theory end ? .\nThe only way that I can think of that they truly end be that we find evidence for it , and then we just call it a conspiracy .\nBut this also point to why conspiracy theory be such interesting device .",

illness be not a predictor of violence towards others , but it be a predictor of suicide .\nProvide training to gun shop and shoot range employee to identify at-risk person whose sole intent in purchasing ( or rent ) a gun be to die by suicide .\nModeled on domestic violence restrain order law , ERPO \u2019 s avoid stigmatize person with mental illness because they be not focus on mental illness but on the risk of gun violence .\nPersons with gun in the home be also more likely to have die from suicide commit with a firearm than from one commit by use a different method ( adjust odds ratio = 31 .\nAlthough these study be useful in demonstrate an association between access to firearm and rate of homicide and suicide at the aggregate level , it be not possible with this methodology to adequately assess whether access to a gun increase the risk of a violent death at the individual level .\nHowever , study conduct in other country have fail to find a clear link between access to a firearm and risk of a suicide ( 22 ) .\nThose person with gun in the home be at significantly great risk than those without gun in the home of die from a firearm suicide versus one commit by use other mean ( adjust odds ratio = 31 .\nThe finding show an increase risk of homicide in home with gun be also consistent with previous research ( 14 , 20 , 23 , 24 ) , although , when compare with suicide , be not a strong .\nOur finding also suggest that the presence of a gun in the home increase the chance that a homicide or suicide in the home will be commit with a firearm rather than by use other mean .\nVictims of suicide living in home with gun be more than 30 time more likely to have die from a firearm-related suicide than from one commit with a different method .\nGuns be highly lethal , require little preparation , and may be choose over less lethal method to commit suicide , particularly when the suicide be impulsive .\nSuicidal person may also be more likely to acquire a gun to commit suicide and , give the lethality of the weapon , be more likely to complete suicide , although the evidence on this point be mix ( 20 .\nFor victim of homicide , there be also a strong association between gun in the home and risk of die from a firearm-related homicide , but this risk vary by age and whether the person be live with others at the time of death .\nIn our study , the risk of die from a firearm-related homicide or suicide be great in home with gun , but this risk do not vary by specific firearm-related characteristic .\nSecond , the gun in the home may not have be the gun use in the death .\nThis possibility seem less likely with suicide , but , with homicide , it be certainly plausible that someone bring a gun into the home .\nThird , it be possible that the association between a gun in the home and risk of a violent death may be relate to other factor that we be unable to control for in our analysis .\nIt have be suggest that high rate of suicide and homicide in area with the high rate of gun availability may indicate impulsivity and ease of locate firearm ( 37 , 49 ) .\nAlthough men with access to firearm may have high odds of commit suicide than woman , woman have high odds of homicide victimization .\nThe availability of firearm in the home may not be the catalyst for suicidal ideation , but firearm may be a preferred method of suicide among those who have suicidal think .\nThe presence of a firearm in the home have be find to be an independent , additional risk factor for suicide .\nWhile suicidal behavior be not genetically inherit , it can be socially learn from significant others and many risk factor for suicide can be inherit .\nWhat to do if you do keep a gun in your home If you decide to keep gun in the home , be aware that many study show that teach kid about gun safety , or to not touch a firearm if they find one , be not enough .\nNo matter how much instruction you may give about how to safely shoot a gun , child be not capable or responsible enough to handle a potentially lethal weapon .\nLet me assure you that legally own gun be use to kill many of those woman .\nAccess to a firearm , particularly during a time of increase risk for suicide ( e .\n[ 4 ] This be not to say , however , that gun owner must sell their firearm in order to reduce firearm suicide .\n[ 63 ] If this person do not have access to a highly lethal mean such a a firearm during this crisis , she or he be more likely to survive the crisis either by attempt suicide with a less lethal mean and survive or by opt not to make an attempt at all .\n[ 64,65 ] Their choice of method do not leave room for a change of heart later , whereas other method do , and we see the change of heart in the literature on those who survive suicide attempt .\nSuicide attempt be often impulsive act , and a majority of people who attempt suicide do not go on to die by suicide .\nPeople be at least 40 time more likely to die if they attempt suicide with a gun instead of other common method .\nCompared to other variable , gun access be the most correlated with suicide death on an individual level as well .\nBut most people who attempt suicide do not die\u2014unless they use a gun .\nAnd the vast majority of those who survive a suicide attempt do not go on to die by suicide .\nA suicide attempt be when people harm themselves with the goal of end their life , but they do not die .\nTo put this in perspective , more than half of all suicide , for example , involve the use of a firearm .\nBut when a gun be not available , an attempt at suicide the death rate drop precipitously .\nThose who die by suicide be twice as likely to have a gun at home than either of the other two group .\nThe risk of suicide be high immediately after the purchase of a handgun , suggest that some firearm be specifically purchase for the purpose of commit suicide .\nIf firearm be available to a person who be think about take his or her life , the presence of firearm might be link with a high likelihood of suicide and high regional suicide rate .\nWhether the mere availability of a gun increase the risk of suicide be a complex question to disentangle from observational data because some of the association between gun accessibility and suicide be likely attributable to the fact that those who wish to kill themselves may go out of their way to procure a gun or otherwise ensure that a gun be accessible .\nOthers with access to gun may be at high risk of suicide because their attempt to kill themselves with an available gun be more likely to be fatal than if they have use a less lethal mean , such a poison or drug overdose .\nThe next-best source of rigorous evidence , quasi-experimental observational study , may never be able to adequately control for the myriad , sometimes intersect , reason why individual might want gun available and might also wish to kill themselves .\nA concern with all such study be the possibility that case and control may not be match on important characteristic that influence both the person \u2019 s decision to acquire firearm and his or her risk of suicide .\nThe difference could suggest that gun access increase the risk of suicide , or they could suggest that people who be suicidal may obtain gun at a high rate because they be consider kill themselves with gun .\nAn individual feeling suicidal may acquire a firearm a a mean to take his or her life and thus make the weapon readily available in the household .\nOther work have use different control group to attempt to address this selection bias ( that suicidal people be more likely to acquire gun so that they can kill themselves ) .\nAlthough suicide attempt and ideation be not reliable proxy of suicide risk , these study do yield insight into the difference in suicidality between those who have access to gun and those who do not .\nAmong those who die by suicide , those live with a gun in the home be more likely to take their life use a gun than other mean .",

Nearly all this debt will result from general revenue transfer into the Social Security and Medicare system to close their widening shortfall , as well a the added interest cost on the national debt create by these shortfall .\nThese reform could keep Social Security and Medicare from drive unsustainable deficit , and ultimately maintain fiscal space for other priority .\nAs rates\u2014and the

the program 's annual cash flow deficit .\n, with no change in tax or spending policythis would happen without credit additional security to either the Social Security or Medicare trust fund .\nAs Social Security run those cash deficit , the trust fund will \u201c redeem \u201d their Treasury security and the Treasury will have to borrow fund from the public to cover the shortfall .\nYou will

.\nLED bulb be the most efficient light bulb available , use just a tenth of the energy of an incandescent bulb .\nSitting in the dark all day be not ideal but choose the right light bulb can both drastically reduce power bill and positively affect the environment .\nClearly , the cost save from switch to efficient light source can result in a low power bill .\nSince LEDs use so much less electricity than other bulb and convert it mostly into light , they stay cool to the touch , which reduce the risk of fire and/or burn .\nIn the future , it will be important to know how these different wattage translate in term of light output ( or lumens ) a this will replace wattage a the key characteristic for identify light bulb .\nWith advanced LED and CFL bulb , however , the amount of energy use isn \u2019 t a important a the amount of light ( lumen ) provide .\nWhy have no one ever talk about the heat a incandescent bulb give off , that would reduce the cost of heat your home .\nGiven the number of fixture that exist and use these sort of bulb ( and the fact that such fixture typically use multiple bulb ) , the use of LEDs have the potential to result in HUGE saving in term of electricity use for light .\nIn my honest opinion , the cost of the lead bulb just doesnt ring up to save that be the worth the purchase .\nYou might not wish to replace all of your bulb with LEDs at the same time because of the cost , but be hopeful that perhaps people will gradually replace their traditional bulb with energy-efficient alternative like LEDs .\nOne item you probably don \u2019 t think twice about be your light bulb .\nIndividual light bulb win \u2019 t use a lot of energy , but the cost can quickly add up .\nLeaving one light bulb on during the night will probably not make a dent in your wallet , but you shouldn \u2019 t get into the habit of leave light on at all time .\nAlthough the energy cost of leave one bulb on for the day isn \u2019 t high , these cost can quickly add up .\nAdvertisement The problem with incandescent light bulb be that the heat waste a lot of electricity .",

    "evidence": "In the era of potent antiretroviral therapy , a high level of condomless anal intercourse continue to drive increase in HIV incidence in recent year among men who have sex with men .\nIntroduction Men Who Have Sex With Men a an Important Target for HIV Prevention Although a steadily decrease trend have be observe for the global HIV burden , the epidemic have continue to expand among men who have sex with men [ ] .\nDespite biomedical advance in antiretroviral therapy and grow access to care and treatment , there be a paradoxical rise in the HIV incidence rate among men who have sex with men that be find to be significantly associate with an increase in condomless anal intercourse [ , ] .\nUtilizing Web-Based HIV Prevention Interventions for Men Who Have Sex With Men Web-based technology have be recognize a a powerful tool to efficiently reach target population and deliver behavioral intervention to enhance response to the ongoing HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men [ ] .\nMoreover , a considerable proportion of men who have sex with men actively use the internet for socialize and sex-seeking , which have be find to increase likelihood of condomless anal intercourse , and consequently , risk of HIV infection [ - ] .\nHence , web-based intervention can seize the opportunity to promote HIV prevention among men who have sex with men at a crucial point when they tend to engage in risky sexual practice .\nFor example , the participant emphasize the phenomenon of \u201c complacency about HIV \u201d among local men who have sex with men ( ie , that strong belief about antiretroviral therapy efficacy contribute to low-risk perception and high motivation to engage in condomless anal intercourse ) .\nresearch study demonstrate that there be no significant difference in HIV risk between men who have sex with men who \u201c inconsistently use condom \u201d and those who \u201c have never ever use condom .\nhave sex without a condom be a guy who have sex with other guy have have sex with more than three partner in the past year get an STD ( sexually transmit disease ) share needle to inject drug be a woman and be pregnant If My HIV Test Is Negative , Does that Mean My Sex Partner Is Negative Too ? .\nOne Approach be a 1983 manual by Richard Berkowitz and Michael Callen , under the direction of Joseph Sonnabend , to advise men who have sex with men ( MSM ) about how to avoid contract the infecting agent which cause AIDS .\n7 The misconception that there be something inherent in the lifestyle of all gay men that put them at risk for infection be common at the time and lead to the development of a stigma surround both the disease and gay sex .\nDavid France estimate that less than 1 % of men who have sex with men in New York City use them regularly in the 1970s , despite the fact that many other sexually transmit disease , include cytomegalovirus and hepatitis B , be already at `` endemic `` level .\n[ edit ] Callen , Berkowitz and Sonnabend begin this section by state that , regardless of how controversial and subjective the question may be , some people with AIDS do continue to have sex after be infect , whether knowingly or unknowingly , although many may be so incapacitated that sex be `` the furthest thing from their mind .\nIn all likelihood , the author contend , the risk of unprotected sex to the person with AIDS be high than to the uninfected person , a any number of STDs can have a dangerous health impact on someone with a compromise immune system .\n9 However , the reality be that the risk of have sex with someone with AIDS be high than they describe because it be cause by a single virus ( HIV ) that PWA ( and people with HIV pre-AIDS ) have and uninfected people do not .\nIn this section , the author discuss the difficulty pose by the obvious connection between gay sex and the disease , especially give that men who have sex with men , as well a transgender woman , be , even before the outbreak of AIDS , often accuse of have too much sex by the Moral Majority .\n2009 meta-analysis ( Weiss ) of the benefit to woman of circumcise men find no evidence that have sex with a circumcise , rather than an uncircumcised , man reduce the risk of HIV infection to woman , though there have be study that show that male circumcision reduce the risk of human papillomavirus ( HPV ) and genital herpes ( HSV2 ) in woman .\nAlthough the survey of men last year find that HIV prevalence in uncircumcised men be 19 % and circumcise men 7 % ( average be 12 % ) , in woman prevalence be 30 % , and in the peak age of 30-34 rise to 38 % .\nConversely , heterosexual men be perceive a active transmitter of HIV but not active agent in prevention .\nConversely , heterosexual men be active transmitter of HIV but not active agent of prevention .\nThe paradigm assume not only that woman ( but not men ) want to prevent HIV but lack the power to do so , but also that men be more likely than woman to bring HIV into the partnership .\nThe model tend to ignore how heterosexual men contract HIV themselves and how variability in biosocial and cultural context influence woman 's and men 's probability of infection if expose .\nUpwards of 70 % of transmission worldwide be now between a man and a woman,10 but program and policy largely fail to include the prevention need of men who have sex with woman .\n13 Close identification of the virus with gay men , and later injection drug user , mean that researcher fail to recognize or focus on heterosexual transmission for many year after the first case be diagnose in the United States .\n13 Surveillance statistic , however , show that heterosexual transmission account for more infection among woman than men , suggest that woman might be at great risk of infection if expose through heterosexual intercourse .\nIndeed , feminist research and advocacy both in the United States and internationally bolster the vulnerability model by describe the myriad way in which gender inequality could put woman at risk for HIV in their primary relationship with men .\nDespite the fact that heterosexual men , too , be infect with HIV ( and can not infect a woman without be infect themselves ) , HIV risk translate into vulnerability only for woman , who unlike men be consider deserve of protection from AIDS .\nOne rarely encounter \u201c vulnerability \u201d a an operative word in the literature regard US Black or Latino men , let alone African men , men who have sex with men , or male injection drug user , even though these group be also hinder by power differential involve race , ethnicity , social class , sexuality , and global structure of inequality .\nThe \u201c Fixed Fact \u201d of Women 's Biologic VulnerabilitySusser write that \u201c heterosexual transmission , \u201d the term most often use in public health literature to \u201c index the problem of woman contract HIV through sex with men , \u201d can render invisible the difference in risk of infection between men and woman .\nIn set in which men be not circumcise or sexually transmitted infection prevalence be high , for example , gender difference be diminished,90 and men and woman have far more similar probability of infect or be infect than in other setting .\n( 1 ) woman want to prevent HIV when have sexual intercourse with a potentially infected man , but lack the power to do so , and ( 2 ) men be more likely than woman to bring HIV into the partnership because they engage in more sexual and drug use risk behavior .\nHeterosexual men be perceive a active transmitter of HIV but not a active agent in prevention .\nMultiple Sexual PartnersThe vulnerability paradigm also rest on the assumption that men be more likely than woman to bring HIV into the partnership .\n119 Moreover , current demographic and health survey and other population-based survey support the notion that men be much more likely than woman to be unfaithful to a cohabiting partner .\nHowever , in the large epidemic in the world , the dominant HIV epidemiology do not take the form of a few men infect a large pool of woman .\nIn the vulnerability model of recent year , it seem that men be chastise for their behavior , but be not often give skill , tool , or incentive to protect themselves and their partner .\nSimilarly , not all heterosexually active men be equally likely to contract HIV .\nAs one research team note , men be especially likely to opt out of wear mask , believe them to be \u201c shameful , \u201d \u201c a sign of weakness , \u201d and \u201c not cool \u201d \u2014even though men be at high risk than woman of die from coronavirus infection .\nHIV Diagnoses Among Men in the US and Dependent Areas , 2014-2018 * * Based on sex at birth and include transgender people .\nIf gay and bisexual African-American men make up a country , it rate would surpass that of this impoverished African nation \u2014 and all other nation .\nAs a black lesbian myself , I understand the stigma , shame and fear that could drive black gay men to create seemingly straight life while sleep with men \u2014 and end up unwittingly infect their female partner with H .\nThe men be often much old , have be in a marital relationship for a long time , and subscribe to cultural belief of men \u2019 s perceive entitlement to sex [ 14 ] ; for them , openly discuss condom use with their female partner be see a sign of lack of trust and suspicion of unfaithfulness .\nThe risk of HIV infection be especially heighten in this male-dominated patriarchal community where engage in unprotected sex with multiple sexual partner in marriage be acceptable .\nSuggesting that a condom be use result in verbal abuse , physical violence , and force sex for some of the woman , while others would not even think of suggest condom use because they believe that their husband be entitle to sex .\nAIDS be the lead cause of death among young people ( age 10-24 ) in Africa , and second lead cause globally Young woman be twice as likely to acquire HIV a young men A youth bulge in Africa threaten to increase new HIV infection far Unprotected sex be

rate would decline without resort to tax shelter .\nCritics have far state that the cut also increase the budget deficit , shift the tax burden from the rich to the middle and work class , and far increase already high level of income inequality .\n31 A 2006 Treasury Department study estimate that the Bush tax cut reduce revenue by approximately 1 .\nLastly , it be important to note that any fiscal headwind that arise from allow temporary tax cut to expire on schedule could be overcome at a fraction of the cost with more cost-effective , targeted fiscal support .\nIt be simply that the budget deficit would shrink too quickly\u2014that be , public debt would stop rise fast enough\u2014to maintain economic growth , let alone an adequate pace of growth to lower the unemployment rate .\nThis paper attribute the entirety of that interaction effect to the Bush-era tax cut .\nEconomic impact of the Bush-era tax cut Continuation of the Bush-era tax cut would have the large budgetary impact of the major component of the fiscal obstacle course but a relatively low impact on economic growth\u2014even low than the collective impact of other annually renew budget policy that be not intend a fiscal stimulus .\n1 percent of the budgetary impact of the Bush tax cut , but account for nearly half ( 47 .\nAs policymakers consider which of these tax cut to preserve while the economy remain depressed , from a macroeconomic perspective these find indicate that it surely make sense to work from the \u201c bottom-up .\nthe question of cause-and-effect have not be definitively addressed , but the balance of the exist evidence from the current and other recent study certainly suggest that public debt above a certain threshold lead to reduce economic growth .\nTo combat argument that such cut will balloon the national debt , tax cut advocate have argue that the cut could pay for themselves , largely through fast economic growth .\nWhile well-designed tax cut may grow the economy ( often not as much a tax reform ) , there be no case in which they could grow the economy enough to be self-financing .\nAt best , tax cut can finance a fraction of their cost through fast growth .\nThere be broad consensus among economic model that future tax cut win \u2019 t pay for themselves .\nSome model find tax cut would be partially self-financing , while others find the economic feedback would actually increase the deficit effect of tax cut .\nAt Current Rates , Tax Cuts Can \u2019 t Produce Enough Growth to be Self-Financing While well-designed tax cut can promote economic growth that lead to \u201c feedback \u201d revenue , it be not realistic for this additional revenue to be close to a large a the initial tax cut .\nSince the federal government collect only a fraction of fund from any additional economic activity , the added economic growth would need to be many time large than the initial revenue loss .\nNo Reasonable Economic Model Shows Tax Cuts Paying for Themselves Theory aside , there be no evidence that large tax cut could pay for themselves .\nespecially argue that the 1981 and 2001/2003 tax cut pay for themselves .\nThey summarize that most study find either only a very small positive effect or a negative effect on growth due to the deficit-financed nature of the tax cut .\nLooking at revenue a a share of potential GDP , which use cyclical adjustment to account for recession , one can see very clearly the effect of these tax cut on revenue .\nWith regard both the 1981 and 2001/2003 tax cut , CBO find that actual revenue collection be much low than what have be project prior to the tax cut passing .\nIndeed , the 1981 tax cut be such a drain on revenue that lawmaker from both party come together to reverse about one-third of them in 1982 .\nThis revenue loss be also double the amount that CBO expect from the tax cut alone due to economic and technical revision .\nLike the 1980s , CBO do not anticipate the 2001 recession , but the estimate clearly show that the tax cut didn \u2019 t cause an increase in revenue and be a particularly big factor in lower-than-expected revenue once the economy recover .\nThis be why nearly all economic model find that tax cut will at best pay for a fraction of their cost through fast economic growth and at bad may slow growth and further reduce revenue .\nActual experience with tax cut in recent decade verifies this , a both the 1981 and early 2000s tax cut lead to a significant reduction in revenue .\nAt the heart of the fiscal cliff be the Bush Era Tax cut pa by Congress under President George W .\nBush Tax Cuts The Bush tax cut be a series of temporary tax relief measure , some late extend , enact by President George W .\nBush and a Republican-controlled Senate seek to enact deficit-increasing tax cut , the Senate parliamentarian\u2014the official appoint by the Senate to serve a it expert on rule and procedure , whose ruling be follow except in rare instances\u2014informally rule to allow reconciliation bill that increase deficit within the budget window .\nAnd due to the structure of tax rate , which increase a income increase , tax expenditure that be structure a exclusion or deduction typically have regressive impact , provide large benefit to higher-income taxpayer than to those with low income .",

that all country except Papua New Guinea have law mandate some form of parental leave .\nIf the father do not take this reserve part of leave , the family lose that leave period\u2014that be , it can not be transfer to the mother .\nAlternatively , these policy could be positive for employer who previously do not offer leave because they be worry about attract employee who be disproportionately

it .\nWe be here today to discuss what it mean for work Americans across the country that the United States be the only industrialized nation that do not guarantee any access to pay family and medical

whether to implement one have grow .\nThe low participation of low-income worker might be due , in part , to wage replacement benefit not robust enough to support time off .\nThis make the United

that guarantee pay family or medical leave , whether that leave be to care for a new child or a seriously ill family member , or to address one 's own serious health condition .\nThey argue as well that a national pay family and medical leave program , provide through the same type of social insurance mechanism that have work successfully in California , New Jersey , and Rhode Island , would

protection of mother and child .\nIn many country , the number of woman entitle to maternity protection have increase mainly because of the extension of social security plan to woman who be not

.\nThough it appear unlikely that most Russian company be in a position to profit from this change dynamic , Russia \u2019 s wheat export be up dramatically thanks to the decline ruble .\nAs the ruble weaken and the price of labor and other input fall , Russia should be in a position to replace expensive import with more affordable Russian-made good .\nNo supplemental investment mean no sustained economic turnaround and the grow likelihood that a fall ruble will mirror a weaken economy , a oppose to reverse it .\nIn accordance with the propose algorithm of the sanction regime , the closure of international financial borrowing market for Russia should have worsen the investment attractiveness of the Russian economy , slow it growth , and most importantly , provoke a depreciation of the ruble in order to provoke discontent on the part of citizen who have to compel the Russian government to go on political concession to the West .\nOf course , the worsen borrow condition in foreign financial institution to some extent contribute to a slowdown in Russia 's economic growth , but be not determinative for the exchange value of the ruble .\n15 ruble for 1 US dollar , and by March it fell by as much a 8 percent .\nIn turn , the exchange value of the ruble , in our case decline relative to the dollar , directly and indirectly , affect the state of the Russian economy , since it make import more expensive , and domestic product be cheap , stimulate the development of manufacturing industry , and also increase the size of the currency revenue in ruble term .\nMeanwhile , due to the strong fall in the ruble , Russian business begin to compensate for it loss by revise price tag for good upwards , while ordinary citizen who remember well the consequence of the 2008 crisis have a desire to secure their dollar saving , which contribute to a sharp outflow of the currency asset of the population from the banking sector .\nOf course , some pressure on the ruble and the Russian economy during the period under review be present , but it be more political than economic , the main reason for the weakening of the ruble in 2014 after the introduction of sanction objectively be oil price and the policy of the Central Bank of Russia .\nFigure 18 Consequences of the weakening of the ruble for the Russian economy ( Institute for Management of Social Processes , Higher School of Economics , 2015 ) All these factor , and especially the decline in consumer demand , slow down the growth rate of the economy in Russia .\nIn a single day this past week , the ruble exchange rate drop from 59 to 80 to the dollar , further erode confidence in the Russian economy and ensure a deep recession next year\u2014but also briefly turn Moscow into the shopping capital of the world .\n\u201c I wouldn \u2019 t buy it otherwise , but my ruble be lose their value every day , so I \u2019 m try to solve this problem , \u201d she say .\nThe value of the ruble have decrease by more than half in about a year .\nThese figure might have a strong interest in convince other market participant that the ruble be worth less than it current market value .\n\u201d Western country impose sanction on Russia after it annex Crimea earlier this year , which , combine with plummeting oil price , have lead to a steady drop in the ruble \u2019 s value .",

health care act , I dont call them want $ 4,000 a month affordable when you have to live on social security and add in medicare which keep go up .\nMy area of expertise be health insurance , so Ill focus on that .\nSo people who have to buy their own health insurance ( the self-employed , for example ) can qualify for a premium subsidy even with a fairly high income .\nThat mean that people with significant pre-existing medical condition simply couldnt get coverage if they have to buy it themselves ( a oppose to get it from an employer or a government program like Medicare ) .\nGoing without

as well a the 2002 congressional approval of the Iraq war - to aid in turn a page on a long era of US warfare .\n( Hillary Clinton have say that the 2001 AUMF authorize use of force against the Islamic State , but that she \u201c would like to see it updated .\nThe next Congress should repeal the outdated AUMF and replace it with one that authorize the new president to use necessary and appropriate force not only against al-Qaeda and associated group , but also against the Islamic State and other new terrorist group that threaten the United States and it interest .\nThe Biden administration should work with Congress to update the AUMF by replace it with a statute that promote transparency and accountability , and that narrow the war down to those effort necessary to meet a genuine threat .\nOn the subject of legal reform , there be similarly reason to believe that the administration lack interest in contemplate major change .\nThe 2002 Iraq AUMF should be repeal , and the 2001 , the 9/11 , AUMF must be repeal and replace with one that specifically target ISIL and other terrorist group .\nAs I say , I think we need to repeal the 2001 and replace it , but we need to know what the administration 's strategy be and they have not do that .\nconflict with ISIS , Congress should repeal the outdated 2001 AUMF and replace it with a comprehensive new AUMF that authorize the use of force with appropriate limitation against name terrorist group , include Al Qaeda , the Taliban , ISIS , and associate group .\nCongress should also repeal the 2002 AUMF , which be no longer necessary .\nTo start with my bottom line , I believe it be very important a a legal matter that Congress pass a new AUMF against terrorist group that repeal the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force against terrorist group and the 2002 Authorization to Use Military Force in Iraq and replace them with a comprehensive new AUMF that authorize the use of force against the Taliban , Al Qaida , ISIS , and associate group .\nIn his submittal letter to Congress , President Obama state `` Although my propose AUMF do not address the 2001 AUMF , I remain committed to work with the Congress and the American people to refine , and ultimately repeal , the 2001 AUMF .\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer echo Lee in argue that the repeal would eliminate the possibility of a future administration \u201c reach back into the legal dustbin to use it a a justification for military adventurism .\nBut only a week later\u2014after congressional threat to repeal the resolution begin gain credibility\u2014the administration simply , like the Biden White House in February , switch the legal theory it rely on and instead emphasize the president \u2019 s Article II power .",

Oregon and Washington Ban Gillnets on the Columbia King salmon will have a much easy time navigate back up the Columbia River now that Oregon and Washington have both ban gill net from the main course of the river .\n\u201d Advertisement The action take by the Washington and Oregon commission follow a plan propose by Oregon governor John Kitzhaber that will prioritize recreational fishery in the main stem of the Columbia River and eliminate the use of non-tribal gill net in the low Columbia \u2019 s main stem after a transition period .\nJohnson say the underlying conflict in Oregon pit commercial fisherman against recreational angler for access to salmon , and that 's just an argument that date to the 1880s .\nPath to compromise Oregon and Washington 's path to this uncertain moment be set in motion by Kitzhaber in response to a 2012 ballot measure to ban commercial gillnets from the Columbia River .\nThe compromise would only allow gillnets on certain channel of the Columbia by 2017 , and set vague conservation goal with promise to `` enhance the economic viability of Oregon 's recreational and commercial fishery and the community that rely on these fishery .\nMeasure 81 , which would ban the use of gillnets by nontribal commercial fisherman in the inland water of Oregon , but would allow the use of seine net ( which have be illegal for non tribal commercial fishery on the Columbia River since 1948 ) be the most recent clash in the long and unnecessary battle between recreational and commercial fisherman over allocation of salmon in the low Columbia River .\nThe big problem with use the initiative process to change fishery regulation with respect to the Columbia River be that the new regulation would apply only to Oregon commercial fisherman , wholesaler , and processor .\nThe fishery be jointly manage by state ( Oregon and Washington ) , federal , and tribal agency whose overall goal be to conserve threatened and endanger fish population and at the same time , provide maximum opportunity for both recreational and commercial fishing in the Columbia River .\nAs well a prevent Oregon commercial fisherman from use gillnets in the inland water of Oregon , Measure 81 would also ban the sale in Oregon of any fish caught by Washington fisherman on the Columbia River .\nAlthough brother Mark and Steve Fick , lifelong Astoria resident , be not descend from a long line of commercial fisherman like some family on the North Coast , they both derive all or much of their livelihood from salmon in the Columbia River .\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Notwithstanding any

commissioner hop , to prompt negotiation with the Washington Fish and Wildlife Commission to bring the state back together on co-managing the river 's salmon , and still keep their governor happy .\nThe change come after Brown tell the commission in a February letter Oregon 's plan to keep gill-nets on the river would make enforcement `` complicate , confuse and untenable .\n( a ) For a gill

work the low Columbia River since the mid-1800s .\nStatus quo be not an option , WDFW Director Phil Anderson say of Columbia River commercial fishing , which have become more restrictive in recent year in large part because of Endangered Species Act protection for an expansive number of Columbia River basin salmon and steelhead listing .\nTitleFish face-off - A proposal to ban gillnets in Oregon have commercial fisherman up in arm .\nBut the stretch of the Columbia between the commercial fishing deadline at Beacon Rock and Skamania Island remain open to gillnetters during the sport-closure period .\nOn the contrary , in 1935 Washington , by initiative process , prohibit the use of fixed-gear appliance , and the Oregon act simply bring this state into line with Washington in that respect .\n* 477 Another assert ground of unconstitutionality be that the act be an attempt by Oregon to impair the obligation of it contract with the fixed-appliance fisherman , in violation of Art .\nThe argument be that , in effect , the act grant to gill-net fisherman a monopoly of fishing in the Columbia River .\nAnd in the Radich case there be evidence that gill-net fisherman would not permit anyone to use a certain drift who refuse to submit to a certain amount of regulation in fishing and to bear a part of the expense of clear the drift ground of snag and other obstruction .\n`` * * * It will perhaps be sufficient to say that the unreasonableness and arbitrariness complain of consist in the prohibiting of the taking of fish from the Pacific Ocean and river and harbor adjacent thereto by mean of a purse seine , while permit fish to be take therefrom with set net , pound net , gill net , and drag seine ; * * * It seem too plain to justify lengthy discussion that this contention present a legislative , not a judicial , question .\nIt be insist , moreover , that the court may not presume that the people of Oregon give to the measure the care , consideration and study that the legislature presumably would have give it .\nThe low court hold that the title of the act define it purpose only a prohibit the taking of salmon by the use of drag seine , whereas section 1 of the act go beyond the scope of the title in that it make it unlawful to operate drag seine for any purpose .\nThough they agree policy difference will arise between Washington and Oregon because of the change , commercial fisher say the rest of the angler \u2019 fear be blow out of proportion .\nThe state law that govern commercial fishing in the Columbia River be numerous .\n\u201d Additionally , section 2 would prohibit any \u201c wholesaler , canner or buyer \u201d from buy salmon that have be take \u201c by a gillnet or tangle net from the inland water of the state of Oregon .\nI 've see more substance in tale about `` the one that get away `` than Steve Pedery 's July 23 op-ed tout the ballot measure to ban the use of gill net by Oregon commercial fisherman ( ) .\nThis ban will only apply to Oregon commercial fisherman .\nWashington commercial fisherman would still be allow to use gill net on the Columbia River .\nIt simply reallocate the exist commercial fisherman 's share of salmon and sturgeon to .\nOf course , Oregon 's commercial fisherman do n't fish for themselves .\nIn fact , this measure specifically forbids Oregonians from buy these Columbia River fish in their fish market , grocery store and restaurant -- even if they be catch legally by Washington commercial fisherman .\nCommercial fisherman would n't be allow to fish if they be a threat to the Columbia 's salmon and sturgeon population .\nVoters should n't abandon the scientific management of the Columbia salmon harvest in order to create a monopoly for sport fisherman at the expense of Oregon consumer .\nYes , the endorsement be still need by Oregon angler who fish for salmon , steelhead or sturgeon in the river and tributary of the Columbia River Basin .\nThe one that pay the most to keep salmon in the river .\nBanning commercial fishing in the Columbia River would never sell to the public .\nIt also include enhanced terminal fishery off the mainstem of the Columbia where gillnets would still be allow .\nOne of their point be that in Oregon , gillnets be by state law the only allowable method for take salmon for non-tribal commercial fisherman in the low Columbia River .\nThe selective fishing gear require in Governor Kitzhaber 's proposal be not a legal for use by the non-tribal commercial fisherman in Oregon .\nCCA continue to employ a top grade legal team to represent the interest of sport fisherman and our fish resource in assure these reform stay on track .\nRight now , he argue , gillnets be still allow on the river , and gillnetters have a good year of fishing , so they wo n't have suffer any economic harm from the new policy yet .\nOregon Ballot Measure 81 would prohibit the use of gillnets by nontribal commercial fisherman in the Oregon side of the Columbia River .\nIn a publish in The Oregonian , she argue that the ban would allow Washington fishery to continue to use gillnets in the Columbia River , but not Oregon fishery .\n`` This ban will only apply to Oregon commercial fisherman .\nWashington commercial fisherman would still be allow to use gill net on the Columbia River , `` she write .\n`` Is it true that the measure restrict Oregon fisherman on the same river where Washington fisherman would not be restrict ? `` .\nWould a ban , if approve by Oregon voter , only apply to Oregon fisherman but exempt Washington fisherman ?

    "input": "A white family is likely to have about six times as much wealth than a black or Hispanic family coming out of the recession.",
    "evidence": "Summary White household in the United States be far wealthy than black or Hispanic household , a disparity that remain unexplained even after take into account income and demographic factor .\nDistribution of Wealth To well understand the racial and ethnic disparity in wealth , one can examine the distribution of broad component of total wealth and the distribution of component of a narrow form of wealth , mainly financial wealth , which be think to drive much of the observed disparity .\nStudy Shows Racial Wealth Gap Grows Wider The study by the Pew Research Center say the median net worth of a white family in 2009 be 20 time great than that of the average black family , and 18 time great than the average Hispanic family .\n2Lower-income white family experience great loss in wealth during the recession than lower-income black and Hispanic family do .\nOverall , black and Hispanic family be more likely than white family to have zero net worth or to be in debt .\nConsequently , the recession drive wealth inequality between upper-income family and lower- and middle-income family to the high level record .\nMoreover , the median wealth of upper-income white family in 2016 be 25 % great than it pre-recession level , an increase great than for all upper-income family combine .\nIn 2016 , upper-income white family have six time a much wealth a middle-income white family , compare with four time a much prior to the recession .\nAt middle and old age , for example , the median wealth of White family be four to six time great than the median wealth of Black family .\nSpecific government policy and societal discrimination have fee into the creation of a gap , but it also important to consider general trend of wealth accumulation over time .\nOther factor Education have historically influence the creation of a wealth gap , as well .\nEconomic study point to disparate level of family support , inheritance , retirement planning , and emergency saving , as well a average family income , unemployment , and the volatility of the labor market , which have a great impact on Black population than on White population .\n[ 30 ] Back to Top Key Factors Contributing to the Growing Wealth Divide Many factor be drive the growth of the racial wealth gap .\n[ 38 ] Whites be more likely to receive family assistance in make a down payment on a home and generate housing wealth year earlier than black and Latinx family .\nIn fact , the ratio of white family wealth to Black family wealth be high today than at the start of the century .\nWhy be high- and middle-income white family so much wealthy than Black family with the same income ? .\nBlack family who make it to the top of the income distribution in a particular year be more likely than white family to drop out of the top in subsequent year , and their respective wealth level reflect this difference .\nThe same pattern of inequality in the distribution of wealth across all family be also evident within race/ethnicity group ; for each of the four race/ethnicity group , the mean be substantially high than the median , reflect the concentration of wealth at the top of the wealth distribution for each group .\nWhite family have more wealth than Black , Hispanic , and other or multiple race family in the 2019 SCF .\nThat say , the faster growth in wealth for Black and Hispanic family only result in modest change in the gap in wealth between these family and White family .\nFor example , amongst family under 35 , White family have between $ 11,900 and $ 24,800 more in median wealth than Black , Hispanic , or other family .\nWith respect to the Black-White gap at middle and old age , the median wealth of White family be four to six time great than the median wealth of Black family .\nFor these reason , wealth ( or a lack thereof ) can persist across generation and reflect , among other factor , a legacy of discrimination or unequal treatment in housing , education , and labor market .\nWhite family be substantially more likely to receive inheritance , gift and other family support than Black and Hispanic family Source .\nGet the Deloitte Insights app The unique nature of the current recession4 have increase the odds that these exist disparity in income and wealth will be exacerbate because of differential in occupational employment among US racial group .\nBut when it come to wealth \u2014 a measure by asset , like cash saving , home and retirement account , minus debt , like mortgage and credit card balance \u2014 white family have far outpace black and Hispanic one .\n\u201d Many expert consider the wealth gap to be more pernicious than the income gap , a it perpetuate from generation to generation and have a powerful effect on economic security and mobility .\nBlack family also be hit disproportionately by the housing collapse , because head into the recession housing constitute a high proportion of their wealth than for white family , leave them more exposed when the market crash .\nEven if black and Hispanics make progress in the year ahead a the economy improve , the persistence of the wealth gap have push many public policy scholar to recommend the adoption of more ambitious program to help reduce worsen inequality .\nIndeed , Hispanic family have only slightly more wealth than black family .\nThis report focus solely on wealth , which be substantially more concentrated among America \u2019 s richest household than income , and thus leave many households\u2014especially black households\u2014economically insecure .\nWealth be more concentrated than income , and it concentration have grow for both black and white .\n( see Table 1 ) The Great Recession do great damage to black wealth than it do to white wealth , widen the racial wealth gap even far over the past decade .\nThe persistent racial wealth gap in the United States be a burden on Black Americans as well a the overall economy .\nThe United States have spend the past century expand it economic power , and it show in American family wealth .\nIn fact , the racial wealth gap between black and white family grow from about $ 100,000 in 1992 to $ 154,000 in 2016 , in part because white family gain significantly more wealth ( with the median increasing by $ 54,000 ) , while median wealth for black family do not grow at all in real term over that period .\ncom The widen racial wealth gap disadvantage black family , individual , and community and limit black citizen economic power and prospect , and the effect be cyclical .\ncom Estimating the economic impact of close the racial wealth gap be a daunt task because the gap be the product of complex interaction among social , historical , political , and institutional force .\nUnsurprisingly , the barrier to wealth building for black family be numerous enough to merit in-depth exploration , so we have dedicate this report to understand the piece of black Americans financial life that add up to significantly less than those of their white peer .\nIndeed , the public , private , and social sector will need to contribute to rectify structural inequity that contribute to the racial wealth gap .\n6 time more likely than white and Hispanic family to live in area of concentrated poverty .\nThe Black-white wealth gap serve a an important factor in understand how economic recovery can become uneven and unequal across demographic .\nThe Intersection of the Black-white and Gender Wealth Gaps In addition to the Black-white wealth gap , a gender wealth gap ( and it intersection with race ) reveal another dimension of wealth inequality .\n6 time great than that of single Black men ( $ 1,550 ) , and 224 .\nWhite household be substantially more likely to expect and receive inheritance than Black household .\nUpon receipt of a tax refund , Black and Hispanic family increase their expenditure more so than White family , difference that be explain by racial gap in liquid and financial asset buffer .\nThe private , nonprofit , and government sector all have important role to play a policymakers , service provider , and employer in close racial gap in income and wealth .\nWe then present new research show that although difference in save rate , inheritance , and rate of return on investment have all be suspect a play a large role in maintain the racial wealth gap , the gap be primarily the result of a sizeable and persistent income gap .\nThe Great Recession have a large impact on average black wealth than on white wealth .\nThird , other factor we might have suspect a play major role in maintain the racial wealth gap pale in comparison to the role of the labor income gap .\nWhile our study be only one contribution in the broad literature on the racial wealth gap , our analysis support the conclusion that the racial labor income gap be the primary driver behind the large and persistent difference in average wealth between black and white household .\nThis be particularly worrying because black household have always trail significantly behind their white counterpart when it come to wealth accumulation , and recession expand that gap .\nA big part of the reason that the recession hit black Americans so hard be that it gutted home value , and home ownership be a much more significant part of the group \u2019 s overall wealth .\nIn 1963 , family near the top have six time the wealth ( or , $ 6 for every $ 1 ) of family in the middle .\nBoth measure be important because average wealth indicate how a group be prosper a a whole relative to other group , while median wealth show how the typical family be do .\nBy 2016 , the average wealth of white family ( $ 919,000 ) be over $ 700,000 high than the average wealth of black family ( $ 140,000 ) and of Hispanic family ( $ 192,000 ) .\nPut another way , white family wealth be seven time great than black family wealth and five time great than Hispanic family wealth in 2016 .\nWhite family accumulate more wealth over their life than black or Hispanic family do , widen the wealth gap at old age .\nin 1989 , white family have about $ 25,000 more ( or five time more ) in average retirement save than black and Hispanic family .\nWhite family be five time more likely than black family to receive large gift or inheritance , which can be use to pay for college .\nImportantly , broaden gap be likely to be persistent over time a wealth be pass down across generation through inheritance , contribution to college tuition , and more .\nChildren from the least wealthy family be six time less likely to graduate from college than child from the wealthy family .\nWealth trend for black and Hispanic child household have diverge , and by 2016 , Hispanic child household have more net worth than black child household .\nBecause there be a rich body of research on racial/ethnic wealth inequality among the total population ( inclusive of child household and childless household ) , we start with an overview of what be know about racial/ethnic difference in household wealth for the total population and the mechanism that produce these inequality .\nBeyond home ownership , education debt be arguably the most important factor in racial/ethnic inequality in wealth ( Addo , Houle , and Simon 2016 ; Killewald and Bryan 2018 ) .",

to fewer good job , especially for less educated worker ; and to rise income inequality .\nThe cost of employer-provided health insurance , largely invisible to employee , not only hold down wage but also destroy job , especially for less skilled worker , and replaces good job with bad job at low wage .\nHealth care cost directly hurt those without insurance , while those who be insure must pay co-payments , deductible and employee contribution .\nThese very large number be just the waste of health care .\nOther country spend less of their GDP on health care but have the same increase trend .\nMaking matter bad , participant in the health care system do not even agree on what they mean by cost .\nThe Challenges of Health Care Costing Accurate cost measurement in health care be challenge , first because of the complexity of health care delivery itself .\nThe widespread confusion between what a provider charge , what it be actually reimburse , and it cost be a major barrier to reduce the cost of health care .\nBut the problem be compound when the reimbursement rate be also use to allocate physician cost to patient , a purpose for which they be never intend .\nMany health care system participant , include economist and accountant , believe that most cost in health care be fix because so much care be deliver use share staff , space , and equipment .\nIf most cost be fix , growth in demand for health care would increase only that small fraction of cost that be variable , lead to low average cost in the system , not the dramatically high share of GDP now be devote to health care .\nThere have be criticism that the change will cause many people to drop their private health insurance , cause a further burden on the public hospital system , and a rise in premium for those who stay with the private system .\nThe government subsidise the premium for all private health insurance cover , include hospital and ancillary ( extra ) , by 10 % , 20 % or 30 % , depend on age .\nall people work be require to pay a portion of their income to a not-for-profit health insurance fund , which mutualises the risk of illness , and which reimburse medical expense at vary rate .\nSecondly , since 2000 , the government now provide health care to those who be not cover by a mandatory regime ( those who have never work and who be not student , mean the very rich or the very poor ) .\nIn addition to the long-term trend for increase healthcare cost , short-term factor can also make a big difference .\nSynopsis An 11-country survey find that adult in the United States be far more likely than those in other country to go without need care because of cost and to struggle to afford basic necessity such a housing and healthy food .\nhealth system be compound by high health care cost , great income disparity , and relatively low level of spending on social service .\nbe more likely than those in the 10 other country to go without need health care because of cost .\nhave make significant progress in expand insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act , it remain an outlier among high-income country in ensure access to health care .\nThe Bottom Line Despite progress since passage of the Affordable Care Act , adult in the United States remain more likely to go without need health care because of cost compare to adult in other high-income country .",

    "evidence": "Romney have only far align himself with a radical budget plan that tilt our economy even more in favor of the wealthy at the expense of broad-based economic prosperity .\nBut far down the income scale , the benefit would be considerably less .\nNevertheless , Romney have insist that under his tax plan once he release the rest of it the wealthy would pay the same share of the tax burden that they do at present .\nSuch a reduction by itself would be unprecedented , and would require deep reduction in many popular tax benefit range from the mortgage interest deduction , the exclusion for employer-provided health insurance , the deduction for charitable contribution , and benefit for low- and middle-income family and child like the EITC and child tax credit .\nAny reduction in revenue due to the low corporate rate would be offset by reduce corporate tax preference .\nBut Romney be not argue that more job and growth should compensate for a tax system that put a great burden , or a large share of a reduced burden , on middle-income taxpayer .\nRomney counter that under his plan , the rich will pay the same share of tax they do today .\nWhile he provide no detail , Romney says\u2014among other things\u2014that the net effect of his tax cut and revenue raiser be A ) no increase in the deficit and B ) high-earners will pay the same share of tax a they do today .\nIn the long term , she say , you can argue that that we would essentially be reduce the budget , because we may see less dependency on safety net program across generation .\nTaxpayers earn between $ 200,000 and $ 1 million also would benefit , although the margin would be less lopsided .\nTrue , any across-the-board tax cut would give more money to the rich in dollar term , because they pay most of the tax in the first place .\n\u201d If this be truly his intention , he could have propose tax cut that be proportional to income\u2014say , by offer simply to cut everyone \u2019 s tax rate by a few percentage point , rather than by a certain percentage .\nThis would give the rich a big tax cut in dollar term while preserve the distributional structure of our tax system .\nHence , the most probable outcome would be a tax system that be radically less progressive , achieve through cut that would create a much large long-run budget deficit .\nIt would be a classic tax reform\u2014lowering rate while eliminate tax preference .\nAny cut in tax preference , he say , would be \u201c primarily limit \u201d to those with high income .\nIt still find that the plan would likely result in a tax increase for lower- and middle-class Americans and a tax cut for the high earner .\n`` Such a reduction by itself would be unprecedented , and would require deep reduction in many popular tax benefit range from the mortgage interest deduction , the exclusion for employer-provided health insurance , the deduction for charitable contribution , and benefit for low- and middle-income family and child like the EITC and child tax credit .\nIt 's worth note that this approach would be a very progressive way to raise money from tax expenditure .\nThese reality , combine with the sheer size of the child benefit in Romney \u2019 s plan , mean that swap out these tax benefit for the child allowance be a good trade for just about all U .\nReversing a small portion of Donald Trump \u2019 s tax cut for the rich would be sufficient to cover the cost of Romney \u2019 s program .\n[ 3 ] Economists recognize that there be more to a tax cut than the immediate increase in wealth of the recipient .\nMost tax reduction do not completely pay for themselves with high revenue , but they do add to economic growth and income , create a significant net benefit to the public .\nSome tax change that aim directly at capital formation can trigger enough additional plant building , equipment purchasing , and hire to come close to , or even more than offset , the initial revenue reduction .\nThese include reduction in the estate tax and step that offset some of the double taxation of corporate income , include low corporate tax rate and low tax on capital gain ( which hit retained after-tax corporate earnings ) and dividend ( which be pay out of after-tax corporate earnings ) .\nOur result indicate that these tax cut do pay for themselves , mean they benefit the federal government and the rest of the economy , include federal income taxpayer , low-income people who owe no federal tax , and state and local government .\nThis add physical capital boost productivity , wage , and employment , which result in added personal income and additional tax revenue from the high income and payroll .\nSuch a rate cut be one of the few case where the tax own revenue may rise with a rate cut .\nThese base broadeners offset the benefit of the reduction in the corporate tax rate .\nIf the plan be make budget neutral instead of revenue neutral , the revenue shortfall could be cover by reduction on the spending side of the budget , include corporate welfare subsidy or reduction in low value federal project .\nSelling a portion of the government asset hold would have the dual advantage of allow the nation resource to be use more efficiently and help finance the temporarily high cost of tax reform in the early year before the positive growth effect kick

take office and be nearly $ 20 trillion when he leave .\nUnder President Donald Trump , the debt also have climb .\nPresident Barack Obama 's administration rack up nearly as much debt in eight year than in the entire 232-year history of the country before he take office .\nIn debt-to-GDP term , the public debt rise from 75 percent when Trump take office to 76 .\nThe main culprit of public debt be budget deficit , which have surge under Trump though the CBO now expect the shortfall to be a cumulative $ 1 .\nAs a result of the federal government 's enormous debt and deficit , substantial inflation could break out in America in the next few year .\nhistory have be accompany by a sharp rise in debt a the government raise fund to pay for the fighting .\nWhile the statistic be true ( the debt have either nearly , fully , or more than double since Obamas first inauguration , depend on the measure of debt ) , it be a vast overstatement to place the entire blame on Obama ; rather , it complicate .\nBy Most Measures , Debt Roughly Doubled Under Obama From a numerical standpoint , Trump be correct that the debt have almost double in dollar term since Obamas first inauguration .\nFirst of all , much of the debt increase be the result of law and economic condition in place before Obama take office rather than law that pa under his presidency .\n1 trillion when Obama leave office and these projection didnt incorporate the entire depth of the Great Recession , which reduce revenue and therefore further increase debt .\nBy a few metric , debt have double during the Obama presidency .\nThe blame though be not only on him because some of the debt increase over the past eight year be already expect to occur , and Congress have to approve bill that increase the debt .\nObama win re-election , and his budget projection prove accurate , the National Debt will top $ 20 trillion in 2016 , the final year of his second term .\nThe national debt nearly double during Barack Obamas presidency but accelerate even faster under President Donald Trump , in part because of the Republican overhaul of the U .",

react cautiously against any sanction decision which could lead to arm clash while express grave concern over North Korea 's missile and nuclear test .\n\ufffd ] North Korea once show a positive attitude toward intergovernmental dialogue on the issue of South Korean abductees , but suspend the talk in protest against the South 's reaction after the missile launch .\nThe South Korean military have announce the launch shortly after it happen on Tuesday , but it do not reveal the missile 's maximum altitude and flight distance afterwards , information it normally make available within around an hour .\nIf Biden ignore or react little to North Korea 's provocation , Kim might take strong military action , include launch an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the U .\n`` If

such a missile .\nThe Kim regime display a panoply of new missile for the occasion\u2014but the test-firing of a missile the next day fail , perhaps a a result of American sabotage .\nWhen he have nuclear ICBMs , North Korea will have a more potent and lethal strike capability against the United States and it ally , but no chance of destroy America , or win a war , and therefore no good chance of avoid the inevitable consequence of launch a nuke .\nBut a scary a all of that sound , there be no real reason to think the US be actually plan to launch a war with North Korea anytime soon \u2014 which be the condition under which North Korea say it would actually try to launch a nuclear strike against the US .\nRe-Entry Capability After the July 4 ICBM test , South Korea cast doubt on whether

status of specific weapon cite security concern but say our military have build the capability to counter North Koreas short range missile by modernize our force , and we plan to develop it even far

.\nOn some occasion , the debt limit have be use successfully to help prompt deficit reduction , and in other case , Congress have tack on debt ceiling increase to deficit reduction effort .\nAt the same time , the need to raise the debt ceiling can serve a a useful moment for take stock of our fiscal state and for pursue revenue increase , entitlement reform , and/or spending reduction .\nThe debt ceiling also measure gross debt , which mean that even if the budget be balance , the debt ceiling would still have to be raise if surplus accumulate in government trust fund like Social Security .\nIn exchange for the debt limit increase , this legislation include a budget process reform that reinstituted statutory PAYGO procedure that require tax cut and mandatory spending increase to be fully offset ( with some exemption ) .\nInformally , the agreement to raise the debt ceiling also lead to the creation of a National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform ( also know a the Simpson-Bowles commission ) .\nOn that date , the debt ceiling be reinstate at the current level of borrowing , result in a de facto increase of about $ 500 billion and bring the debt ceiling to $ 17 .\nThe Federal Debt Ceiling The federal debt ceiling be the legal amount of federal debt that the government can accumulate or borrow to fund it program and pay for fee such a the national debt interest .\nRaising the debt limit be a matter of pay bill that we 've already incur .\nWhile the deficit measure the amount of borrow the government do over a set period , typically a year , the debt be the sum of all accumulated borrowing , less repayment , that the government have do up to a give point in time .\nEven though the economy have be strong in recent year , the deficit be project to pass $ 1 trillion again in the near future , in large part due to a combination of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and various spending increase .\nthat a vote to raise the debt ceiling be a vote for new spending program .\nIn fact , however , raise the debt limit be about pay for past choice , and debt limit debate be about whether Congress should authorize the government to borrow to pay for spending that it have previously authorize .\nAt the same time , the Obama administration think that the threat of the debt ceiling could make it easy to pass unpopular measure to help address the long term fiscal situation ( for instance by cut spending on entitlement program by raise the retirement age or adjust the inflation measure of social security ) and that they could do that in exchange for raise tax on the rich .\nMany commentator have argue that it would make sense to get rid of the debt ceiling , or at least stipulate that if Congress have vote for a spending program it have also authorize the government to pay for that program by borrow if necessary .\nThe debate about spending more or accumulate more debt implicitly occur ( or should have explicitly occur ) when policymakers vote to raise spending or cut tax in the first place .\nThis eliminate the need to have a specific vote on the debt ceiling and thus allegedly spar member the political cost of have vote specifically in favor of authorize more debt .\nToday 's GOP leadership have serve notice that any increase in federal borrowing authority must be package with major spending cut .\nBut that simply underscore the importance of vote down the debt ceiling increase .\nYes , Republicans might still support a tax increase , but spending cut be the first priority , he say .\n`` If the debt limit have become meaningless , a some charge , it be only because Congress have make it so by meekly raise the limit every time it begin to get in the way of government spending .",

occurrence of a 3-year drought a severe a that of 2007\u22122010 2 to 3 time more likely than by natural variability alone .\nWe conclude that human influence on the climate system be implicate in the current Syrian conflict .\nFor Syria , a country mark by poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policy , the drought have a catalytic effect , contribute to political unrest .\nAnalyses of observation and model simulation indicate that a drought of the severity and duration of the recent Syrian drought , which be implicate in the current conflict , have become more than twice a likely a a consequence of human interference in the climate system .\nWe then use observation and climate model to assess how unusual the drought be within the observed record and the reason it be so severe .\nWe also show that climate model simulate a long-term drying trend for the region a a consequence of human-induced climate change .\nWe also present evidence that the circulation

agreement between the model and observational analysis result support the attribution of the century-long negative trend in precipitation to the rise in anthropogenic greenhouse forcing and to the role of the latter in the devastate early 21st century Syrian drought .\nOur thesis that drought contribute to the conflict in Syria draws support from recent literature establish a statistical link
