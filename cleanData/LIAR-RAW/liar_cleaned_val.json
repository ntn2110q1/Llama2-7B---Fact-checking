that it would lead employer to dramatically cut back on hour , and increase the unemployment rate .\nIn the long run , first of all , a I say , get rid of Social Security and Medicare would cause more 95-year-olds to work ; we do n't think that would be an effective economic strategy for boost the economy or particularly wise policy .\nThe report find that there will be less -- that worker will choose to supply less labor , correct .\nAnd then it say that the report be n't take into account factor like that because they 're hard to quantify and be sure about .\nSo employer be cut job because of the Affordable Care Act , that would be a bad thing because that mean somebody who really want a job would n't be able to get one .\nCBO explicitly say that you 're not go to see an increase in the unemployment rate , that when you see change it will be that person who maybe do n't want to work those hour , they still have the option to , they still can , but in that case maybe they 'll decide they do n't need to anymore .\nPart of it be even if the net result of this be a reduction in labor supply , to the degree that reduction and labor supply be voluntary and reflect the choice people be make , you 're go to think about that very differently than if it be business cut back on job .\nYou say that the subsidy be one of the main thing that be cause worker to make these decision ; for example , the 60-hour worker go down to 40 -- now they can do that .\n4KHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor falsely claim that a new report confirm the long-held Republican belief that \u201c million of hardworking Americans will lose their job , \u201d because of the Affordable Care Act .\nUnder Obamacare , million of hardworking Americans will lose their job and those who keep them will see their hour and wage reduce .\nThe estimate reduction stem almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that worker choose to supply , rather than from a net drop in business \u2019 demand for labor , so it will appear almost entirely a a reduction in labor force participation and in hour work relative to what would have occur otherwise rather than a an increase in unemployment ( that be , more worker seek but not find job ) or underemployment ( such a part-time worker who would prefer to work more hour per week ) .\nOn the other hand , the share of worker in part-time job generally decline slowly after recession , so whether that share would have decline more quickly during the past few year in the absence of the ACA be difficult to determine .\nMeanwhile , the report note , health care subsidy to low-income Americans will lead to those people spend money on other thing which will create job .\nThe CBO say the ACAs slide scale of subsidy base on income will provide incentive for some not to work , or to work less , in order to avoid lose out on health care subsidy .\nThe replacement bill , a write , would reverse the coverage gain achieve under the ACA , cause many Americans to lose the health care coverage they have come to depend upon .\nMoreover , the bill would , in effect , shift huge cost onto work family , force many to pay more for bad coverage and push million of American off of health coverage entirely .\nUnder the guise of access , the bill would reduce the financial support that be allow million of low- and moderate-income Americans to afford their monthly premium .\nIn addition to move away from an effective coverage expansion that have provide health care to more than 20 million work people , this proposal would also take many backward step in the continual effort to improve our health care system , include .\nFederal Medicaid funding cap simply shift the cost burden onto local and state government , provider and individual beneficiary , ultimately lead to the loss of Medicaid coverage for million of individual .\nThis new plan do not improve the law\u2014instead , it undermine it and leave behind million of people who have obtain meaningful , affordable insurance that be not possible before the ACA .\nFurther harm the health of woman and family , the American Health Care Act would defund Planned Parenthood , cut off health care\u2014including birth control , cancer screening and other essential health services\u2014for million of woman who have no other health care provider .\nThey find the money to give illegals and people on welfare but they cant find the money to put back our social security , the money we have no choice but to put in to it from our paycheck , people like me live on social security check and so do many others but in a few year that will be take away .\n`` Under ObamaCare , million of hardworking Americans will lose their job and those who keep them will see their hour and wage reduce .\nThe availability of subsidized exchange plan also may encourage worker to retire early rather than stay on the job until they qualify for Medicare at 65 year of age , say the CBO .\n`` The share of worker in part-time job generally decline slowly after recession , so whether that share would have decline more quickly in the absence of the ACA be difficult to determine .",

    "evidence": "Industry group have maintain that increase ethanol production support farmer , improve energy security , low greenhouse gas emission and save money at the pump .\nIt be accept that introduce more ethanol expands fuel supply , reduce the amount of import oil and low the price of gas .\nConcerns about impact of drought on fuel price By devastate corn crop , this year scorch summer temperature will also affect ethanol production .\nThe RFS also set a 15-billion-gallon cap on corn-based ethanol per year , which have urge the industry to look to feedstock alternative , such a algae or wood and grass and other cellulosic biofuels .\nThe price spike be add grist to a yearslong political debate over the federal ethanol blend mandate , know a the Renewable Fuel Standard .\nApril 19 , 2008 \u0097 -- Food price worldwide have rise dramatically in the past few year , due in part to a similarly dramatic rise in the amount of corn use for ethanol production in the United States .\nNow , in an effort to make food less expensive , expert be call for limit on ethanol production , subsidy for corn , and more incentive for biofuels make from nonfood source .\nPart of this increase be due to corn be divert from use a animal feed and food to use a a feedstock for ethanol production .\nA look at the grain market give a good idea of the role that ethanol demand play in food price , say Patrick Westhoff , codirector of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri .\nThe mandate require an increase in biofuel production in the United States , include 15 billion gallon of corn ethanol production by 2015 -- considerably more than the 6 .\n( Notably , high demand for corn for use in ethanol production have actually increase corn export in the short term .\nBut the effect of repeal the mandate on food price depend strongly on the cost of energy .\nAs a result , ethanol production could reach level a high a those set by the mandate anyway , put just as much strain on the corn supply .\nGrowing crop take energy , and country that have to import food be now pay a high price for ship because of fuel cost .\nScaling up technology for make ethanol from nonfood source , such a grass and wood chip , could also help .\nThis phenomenon be be drive by increased demand for corn-based ethanol , which now consume more than 40-percent of corn grow nationwide .\nBetween 2007 and 2008 , ethanol drive a 10 to 15 percent increase in food price , accord to a Congressional Budget Office report .\nBecause corn and soybean be more expensive thanks to the biofuels industry , the cost of livestock feed have go up .\nIt and other refiner be require by federal rule to blend a percentage of their product with renewables like corn-based ethanol .\nAs for high food cost , it maintain that increase transportation cost , speculation on Wall Street and high cost of manufacturing and packaging have more impact than ethanol production .\nThe end game be a cellulosic biofuel that increase wildlife habitat and sequesters carbon on the soil while produce ethanol from a product that be n't use for food .\nCost of corn , ethanol \u2019 s main ingredient , have trend high , with refinery scramble to supply gasoline additive The U .\nPrices for ethanol , the corn-based fuel that be a common additive to gasoline , have rise about 50 % year to date , with the near-term contract trading at about $ 2 .\n`` Now the rise price of corn be fuel a movement to reduce the amount of corn ethanol that be add to American gasoline .\nEthanol 's primary component be corn , so demand for the crop have soar since the ethanol standard be enact in 2005 and increase with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 .\nThe USDA also maintain ethanol have an impact on food price , even if it be an indirect link .\n`` Higher ethanol production definitely and directly raise the price of corn , `` say USDA economist Ephraim Leibtag .\n`` Higher corn price have an impact on food price on the retail level .\nThe case for the ethanol standardNot everyone be convince that ethanol pose such a definite threat to food price .\nBut government ethanol subsidy have meat and dairy producer up in arm over the high cost of their main feed grain .\nIt 's with these food that he 's see the most drastic rise in price .\nEthanol policy increase the cost of food at least 1 .\nWith corn price more closely tie to oil price , when the price of gas go up , it raise the demand for ethanol -- and that mean consumer will feel it in two place .\nThis reduction occur even if feedstock price increase result in an expansion of supply because the expanded feedstock supply will typically reduce the supply of other food crop .\nThe large expansion in the supply of corn in response to ethanol 's growth reduce the amount of acre plant to soybean in the United States .\nEven if a feedstock be not directly use to produce biofuels , it can still affect food supply if the feedstock be grow on land that would otherwise be plant to a food crop .\nTapping these source of biomass for future increase in biofuel production would help to break the link between food and energy price and would significantly increase the net reduction in greenhouse gas emission that we can obtain from biofuels .\nBut one near-term cost of achieve this goal be high corn and vegetable oil price , which have increase and will continue to increase food price .\nCurrent policy do not clearly differentiate between biofuels that use feedstock that affect food price and those that do not .\nFirst , Congress could place a hard cap on ethanol make from corn and on biodiesel make from refine vegetable oil .\nThe current RFS be a floor rather than a cap , and exist tax incentive combine with high crude oil price could make future production of corn ethanol and biodiesel make from refine vegetable oil increase to unintended level .\nSecond , Congress could better target tax credit and fuel standard by base them on the impact each biofuel feedstock have on food price .\nTrending Downloads News Highlighted Research View All There have be a number of recent article and report that have come out attempt to quantify whether the various subsidy for first-generation biofuels , such a corn ethanol and soybean-derived biodiesel , make economic sense .\nBasically , due to the favorable economic structure of sugarcane ethanol over corn ethanol , if this tariff do not exist , the U .\nSome argue that the true amount that first-generation biofuels be subsidize must account for increase in the cost of food .\nbe utilize approximately 30 % of it corn crop to produce ethanol then the price of corn would decrease if that portion of the corn crop be divert to human consumption rather than to ethanol and DDGS production .\nThus , the calculation of corn ethanol 's cost be a combination of direct subsidy like the blender credit , renewable fuel standard , and the import tax on Brazilian ethanol , as well a indirect subsidy in the form of high food price and any positive carbon footprint that might exist .\nIn order to assess the cost and benefit of first-generation biofuels like corn ethanol , we must ask ourselves , how much do the United States save in recent year by substitute domestic ethanol for petroleum fuel ? .\nPerhaps one of the big cause of the rise in food cost be the cost of oil .\n, but there have be major push in ethanol production a an alternative to oil .\nSo ethanol production have lead to less corn for animal feed , which mean that farmer have to pay more to fee their animal , a cost that get pas on to consumer .\nSince corn have be put into almost every process food item , mostly in the form of High Fructose Corn Syrup , you \u2019 ve see the price of those item rise too .\nThe other implication of ethanol be that the cost of other food item , like cereal and grain , be rise because farmer be plant more corn and less wheat and soy .\nIf it cost more to grow the food , and there be high demand , it only make sense that the price be high .\nSo if inflation-adjusted corn price be decline ( in spite of the cost of production increase ) , why do our food cost more ? .\nIn turn , a climate of high energy cost and high demand for raw material make it much easy to hike price in the grocery store .\nWhen we shop at the grocery store , in large part , this be a good bulk of our food dollar go and this be why our food cost more today than it do 20 year ago .\nUsing ethanol and other alternative fuel and advance technology to reduce fuel consumption continue to strengthen national security and reduce transportation energy cost for business and consumer .\nSeveral project currently under way , include the Co-Optimization of Fuels and Engines initiative , seek to understand the potential for improve engine efficiency through the use of ethanol blend and other high-octane biofuels .\nAccording to the Renewable Fuels Association , ethanol production in 2020 account for more than 62,000 direct job across the country , $ 35 billion to the gross domestic product , and $ 19 billion in household income .\nThe relationship be drive by government mandate require increase use of ethanol in gasoline as well a the time require for the ethanol industry to increase capacity to meet the mandate volume .\nThis article examine the question of whether ample corn supply and domestic ethanol market saturation have change the price relationship among these commodity .\nAs crude oil price recover from late 2009 through late 2011 , corn price also increase , but at a fast rate than crude oil a corn supply tighten in response to rapid increase in government ethanol blend mandate and rapid growth in the demand for corn to produce ethanol and distiller grain .\nExpansion in these more distant region be necessary to develop a market for the expanded ethanol production capacity and the increase government ethanol blend mandate .\nRelationship of Corn and Ethanol Prices Figure 6 show the relationship between corn and ethanol price .\nWith the rapid expansion of ethanol production capacity , corn , from mid-2007 through 2013 , become the limit factor in the ethanol supply chain .\nIf ethanol demand do not expand in the future , rise corn yield will likely shift corn back to a chronic surplus supply with relatively low price , except in year of adverse weather .\nInstead of ethanol drive corn price , the reverse may be true with ethanol price be heavily influence by corn impact on ethanol production cost .\nCorn be by far the large cost component of corn-starch ethanol production cost .\nThe Chinese economy and other global fee demand development will continue to be important influence on corn price , but their impact may be less than when ethanol be a rapidly expand industry .\nThat be the emergence of cellulosic ethanol production and increase mandate to use this and other advanced biofuels .\nA new study look at the greenhouse gas benefit of corn ethanol .\nAs it turn out , the data show that the last decade be a time of great innovation and productivity improvement in both corn production and ethanol refinery technology .\nProjections of Increased GHG Emissions due to Land-Use Change Didn \u2019 t Materialize Earlier estimate of ethanol \u2019 s GHG emission assume the increased price of corn ( cause by increased demand for corn ethanol ) would result in farmer bring new land into production ( otherwise know a land-use change ) .\nHow corn be produce on farm and how refinery operate can also have a large impact on greenhouse gas , from the change in soil carbon and the emission associate with grow crop , to the GHG emission from produce the fuel .\nSince 2010 , ethanol refinery have evolve by adopt more efficient process to produce more ethanol per bushel of corn .\nAll this research aside , there be certainly environmental tradeoff involve in ethanol production .\nThey will continue to innovate , increase crop yield and ethanol output , and add in other crop and material to further expand ethanol output a consumer demand increase ( and a high ethanol-gasoline blend be make available at the pump ) .\nVariable cost include expense , such a the cost of corn a ethanol feedstock and the natural gas use to produce thermal energy , along with an assumed fix operate cost of 35 cents/gal .\nOverall profitability for corn ethanol production be largely determine by the relationship between ethanol price and corn price , with corn be the primary feedstock cost in produce ethanol .\n8 gallon of ethanol for every bushel of corn .\nHigher feedstock cost and relatively unchanged ethanol demand have drive ethanol margin and profitability to multiyear low , and current ethanol production level may soon be affect .\nAs I show in my recent study , \u201c The Costs to Developing Countries of US Ethanol Expansion \u201d , the US ethanol programme push up corn price by up to 21 per cent a it expand to consume 40 per cent of the US harvest .\nThe link between high food price and unrest in the region be by now well document , and US ethanol be contribute to that instability .\nBiofuel impact on food price The debate over biofuels have grow urgent since food price first spike in 2007-2008 , usher in a food crisis characterise by repeated jump in global food price .\ncorn and sugar for ethanol , soybean , palm oil and a variety of other plant for biodiesel .\n\u201d Nowhere be the impact clear than in the diversion of US corn into ethanol production .\nThese mandate for rise corn ethanol production combine with tax incentive to gasoline blender and tariff protection against cheap import to create today \u2019 s massive ethanol demand for corn .\nAs corn price rise farmer increase production , but not enough to accommodate the increased ethanol demand .\nFor our study of the impact on corn importer , we rely on estimate of how much low corn price would have be if ethanol production have not grow past it 2004 level .\nProducers be get 15 percent more ethanol from a bushel of corn than 20 year ago .\nIn a report , CBO say large use of ethanol drive up feed price for cattle , hog and poultry and , in turn , result in high retail price for food .\n\u201c Over the same period , certain other factor -- for example , high energy cost -- have a great effect on food price than do the use of ethanol a a motor fuel , \u201d say the report .\nHigher food price will add $ 5 billion to the overall cost of the program .\n\u201c Beyond the one-year period that end in April 2008 , food price be likely to be high than they would have be if the United States do not use ethanol a a motor fuel , \u201d say CBO but it be difficult to gauge by how much .\nEach time the food product be ship , it , along with other input and subsequent by-product or waste , have additional transportation cost .\nFood manufacturer raise price when corn and fuel price be high , however many food price have remain the same or continue to increase when corn and fuel price lower .\nBiofuels , such a ethanol , can be substitute for gasoline .\nWith the current federal policy , expert predict that ethanol production will increase in the future .\nThe effect of ethanol policy on the vertical price transmission in corn and food market - ScienceDirect .\nBut part of the problem derive from ethanol production .\nbe a large exporter of corn and much of

    "evidence": "The medium push come a day after the president attack Romneys tax plan on the stump in Ohio , cite a new study from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that find the change propose by Romney would provide large tax cut to high-income household , and increase the tax burden on middle- and/or lower-income taxpayer .\nStill , Chen say the study look at only half of Romneys plan and ignore the positive benefit to economic growth from both the corporate tax plan and the deficit reduction call for in the proposal .\nUnder the Romney plan , a middle class family will pay an average of up to $ 2,000 more a year in tax , while at the same time give multimillionaires like himself a $ 250,000 tax cut .\nThe fact that Romney hasn \u2019 t detail how he would pay for his propose tax plan , however , make it a target for Democrats to shoot at , which be what the Obama campaign \u2019 s do right now .\nMillionaires in the state would receive an additional $ 87,000 in tax break under the tax plan of Gov .\nRomney \u2019 s top direct donor would receive over $ 2 billion in direct tax benefit from under the Romney-Ryan plan , while a typical police officer in Richmond make a little over $ 48,760 a year would see their tax increase by $ 1,660 .\nRomney \u2019 s top direct donor would receive over $ 2 billion in direct tax benefit from under the Romney-Ryan plan , while a typical police officer in Richmond make a little over $ 48,760 a year would see their tax increase by $ 1,660 .\nRomney \u2019 s plan be to provide the wealthy individual and corporation with additional tax break , while ask the middle class , senior , and student to pay even more .\nRomney \u2019 s tax plan would require raise tax on middle-class family with child who have income under $ 200,000 by an average of $ 2,000 per family .\nThe 6,784 millionaire in the state would see an additional tax cut of at least $ 87,000 .\nTheir plan would force middle-class family to pay more in tax than they do today so that the richest among u pay less .\nThe 6,784 millionaire in the state would see an additional tax cut of at least $ 87,000 .\nScott Winship , director of poverty study at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , say his concern be that a permanent child allowance might make parent less likely to work and reduce the number of two-parent household , since there would be a stream of income from the government .\nMitt Romney , whose plan be different from Biden 's because it eliminate some other popular tax break to make the proposal deficit-neutral , which mean it 's unlikely to gain much support from Democrats .\nNow he have a plan that would give millionaire another tax break and raise tax on middle-class family by up to $ 2,000 a year .\nMitt Romney 's middle-class tax increase he pay less , you pay more .\nObama again highlight a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that conclude Romney 's proposal would provide large tax cut to high-income household and increase the tax burden on middle- and/or lower-income taxpayer .\nIt 's simply that , if you cut tax rate for high-income household , you lose so much revenue there , that you ca n't make it up by shut down the tax exemption that high-income tax household have .\nSo we have to be very careful about read too much into this , because it really be not the Romney plan .\nIt 's correct that Governor Romney have not specify all the detail of his tax reform plan .\nAnd I think what want to do and I 'm not a surrogate for the Romney camp , by any mean I think what they be try to do be stay to the big picture and talk about the big issue here and that their belief be that when you cut marginal tax rate , you see economic growth .\nAnd the answer be because the net the reason why be that the essentially , the average marginal tax rate do n't end up change that much in a revenue-neutral reform .\nHe accuse Romney of propose to raise tax by $ 2,000 on middle-income taxpayer , when Romney have state clearly that he wouldn \u2019 t do any such thing .\nThat \u2019 s a total of about $ 2,300 more than today \u2019 s vehicle \u2014 plus any sale tax on the added purchase price .\nTax rate on family income over $ 250,000 ( and on income by single taxpayer exceed $ 200,000 ) will be high than they be when Clinton be president .\n\u201d Obama \u2019 s $ 2,000 figure come from an analysis by the Tax Policy Center of \u201c a revenue-neutral individual income tax change that incorporate the feature Governor Romney have propose .\nThe TPC calculate whose tax break would need to go \u2014 start at the top \u2014 to make up for the revenue that would be lose by cut rate 20 percent for everybody , a Romney have promise .\nAnd it conclude that \u201c taxpayer with child who make less than $ 200,000 would pay , on average , $ 2,000 more in tax \u201d if Romney cut rate a promise without lose revenue .\nBut this do not prove that Romney will increase tax on those make under $ 200,000 .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t interpret this a evidence that Governor Romney want to increase tax on the middle class in order to cut tax for the rich , a an Obama campaign ad claim .\n\u201d Romney could cut rate less , or let the federal deficit rise more , and still not raise tax on those make under $ 200,000 .\nPolitiFact have give a `` mostly true `` rating to the charge that `` Romney be propose a tax plan `` that would give millionaire another tax break and raise tax on middle class family by up to $ 2,000 a year .\nA portion would be refundable , though , to provide some help to family that don \u2019 t earn enough .\nEven Barack Obama have put his spin on it with a campaign ad that say if you be middle class , Mitt Romney want to raise your tax by up to $ 2,000 even a he cut tax for rich people like himself .\nIf he do , they find it would be impossible for Romney to retain today \u2019 s level of progressivity .\nThat \u2019 s because cut rate this deeply without add to the deficit or raise tax on capital income would require massive cut in those popular tax preference that overwhelmingly benefit the middle- and upper middle-class .\nHe could cut spend even more deeply than he \u2019 s already promise , though that would hurt low- and middle-income household too .\n`` This analysis also find that if Governor Romney want to keep his word and pay for his plan so that he do not increase the deficit even more , the average middle-class family with child would be stick with a tax increase of more than $ 2,000 .\n`` `` We do not score Governor Romney 's plan directly , a certain component of his plan be not specify in sufficient detail , nor do we make assumption regard what those component might be .\n`` Mitt Romney have propose comprehensive , pro-growth tax reform that will lower tax rate for every American , provide certainty for job creator , and get our economy back on track .\n`` But Obama push for spending increase and tax cut that also have contribute in important way to the nation 's fiscal deterioration .",

    "evidence": "Millions of people have lose their health insurance and their doctor because of the Affordable Care Act .\nCritics of the law now say million lose their health insurance .\nMillions of people have lose their health insurance .\nThe AFP ad also make the claim that million of people can \u2019 t see their own doctor , but theres no evidence that all those who have individual market policy discontinue end up not be able to keep their own doctor .\n\u201d After ObamaCare be enact , million of Americans be unable to keep their pre-ObamaCare health insurance plan .\n7 million health insurance cancelations of an exist policy in 32 state .\n\u201d In other word , ObamaCare \u2019 s mandate and regulation have upend the health insurance market , cause million to lose their pre-ObamaCare plan .\nADVERTISEMENTAccording to MarketWatch , \u201c Various source note that a common ( and popular ) way to reduce premium cost have be to reduce the number of doctor in the insurer \u2019 s network , which lead to a much great likelihood of people lose their doctor than without the ACA .\nSadly , since ObamaCare \u2019 s inception one decade ago , the vast majority of Americans be not well off in term of their health insurance cost and health care access .\nUnder Obamacare , insurer lose their ability to pick and choose who they be go to cover .\nadult who contract COVID-19 or lose income during the pandemic also struggle with medical debt , a new Commonwealth Survey show Even a the pandemic ea and more people gain insurance coverage , Black and Latinx/Hispanic adult face serious financial challenge from chronic lack of affordable health care More than half of U .\nGaps in health insurance can leave people expose to high medical bill and prevent them from get health care when need .\nThe survey ask respondent who have lose job-based coverage and do not get COBRA how long they be without insurance .\nPeople cover by either public or private insurance at the time of the survey report problem with medical bill or debt ( some may not have have coverage for the full year ) .\nBut the finding also show that large share of adult continue to suffer financially when they get health care , even if they be cover by Medicare , Medicaid , or private insurance .\nHowever , the regulation be face opposition from a major health insurance group that say it would raise premium .\n7 million insurance policy be cancel a a result of the Affordable Care Act ? .\n7 million insurance policy be cancel a a result of the Affordable Care Act ? .\n7 million health insurance policy be cancel a a result of the Affordable Care Act , despite repeat claim from the President that \u201c If you like your health care , you can keep your health care .\n\u201c About half of people get their insurance from their employer , but it be challenge and frustrate the way engagement occurs .\nRampant job loss and an economic recession have cause million of Americans to lose their job-based health insurance , with some worker switch to marketplace or Medicaid coverage and others become uninsured .\nStill , every year , million of people change or lose their insurance , often at time when the enrollment system be ill-prepared to support them .\nVolatility in employment and income make health insurance churn more likely .\nMillions of people nationwide be unenrolled yet eligible for Medicaid or marketplace coverage with no premium .\n70 Aligning benefit and plan design between Medicaid and marketplace coverage would not reduce churn rate but could lessen the effect of churn on beneficiary , especially lower-income enrollee who churn in and out of Medicaid due to fluctuation in income .\n75 Conclusion Health insurance churn be not only administratively burdensome , but it be also disruptive to patient care continuity and can lead to poor health outcome .\nFirst and foremost , the ACA \u2019 s main challenge be to make health insurance affordable for more people .\nConstant monitoring of the market and patient \u2019 need be require to ensure that flexible and affordable health insurance policy be available for everyone .\nWith this in mind , even with the Affordable Care Act , numerous Americans choose to risk not have health insurance , due to high cost , accord to the Obamacare statistic .\nIt \u2019 s also believe that a large percentage doesn \u2019 t receive insurance coverage through an employer , whereas others be uneducated about the insurance market and it benefit .\nThis statistic help reflect the fact that public coverage be limit in a number of state , thus make it difficult for low-income family to afford health insurance .\nIt \u2019 s important to point out that generally , people win \u2019 t see the use of pay a monthly insurance cost until the health insurance be actually need after a medical emergency or disease .\nThis statistic help showcase how many Americans fear lose their health insurance coverage without the ACA .\n7 million people have lose their insurance in 32 state `` due to Obamacare .\nYou likely remember story about the cancellation notice , which be the result of individual insurance plan not meet the minimum standard of the new health care law .\n6 million people have lose their existing plan due to the minimum standard set by Obamacare .\nIn fact , the key problem with Loesch 's statement be that she say these people `` have lose their insurance , `` a if none of them replace one plan with another .\n4 million people with individual insurance , few than 1 million end up without any coverage at all .\nFinally , we should note that while some people have lose insurance since most of the main element of Obamacare take effect , the net impact have be a boost in the rank of the insured .\nThose who do have that high level of health spending be clearly sick enough that they would benefit greatly from the financial protection that come with health insurance .\nUnfortunately , a large share of the population be unaware that the ACA offer financial assistance to buy insurance .\nMany people who lose employer-based coverage during the pandemic may also be unfamiliar with these option , since they have never have a reason to interact with the Marketplaces or Medicaid .\nwhether or not they have insurance if they have insurance , whether they have experience a gap in their coverage in the prior year whether high out-of-pocket health care cost and deductible be cause them to be underinsured , despite have continuous coverage throughout the year .\n1 Although the ACA have expand and improve coverage option for people without access to a job-based health plan , the law largely leave the employer market alone .\nBut while the cost-sharing reduction have be particularly important in low deductible and copayments for people with income under 250 percent of the poverty level ( about $ 62,000 for a family of four ) , about half of people who purchase marketplace plan , and all of those buy plan directly from insurance company , do not have them .\n4 The ban against insurer exclude people from coverage because of a preexisting condition and rating base on health status have mean that individual with great health need , and thus high cost , be now able to get health insurance in the individual market .\nNot surprisingly , the survey data show that people with individual market coverage be somewhat more likely to have health problem than they be in 2010 , which mean they also have high cost .\nInadequate insurance coverage leave people expose to high health care cost , and these expense can quickly turn into medical debt .\nAmong people who have continuous insurance coverage , the rate of medical bill and debt problem be nearly twice as high for the underinsured a it be for people who be not underinsured .\nIn addition , more people have health plan that fail to adequately protect them from health care cost , with the fast deterioration in cost protection occur in the employer market .\nHealth care cost be primarily what \u2019 s drive growth in premium across all health insurance market .\nHealth insurance coverage in the United States The law cause a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance .\nHowever , many people still express concern over the health of the overall labor market .",

    "evidence": "Medicare may be in trouble , but it be not go bankrupt .\nAccording to a 2021 report by the Biden administration , the Medicare Hospital Insurance ( HI ) trust fund will be deplete if healthcare expense continue to exceed money flow in .\nTaken together , these factor could deplete the Medicare HI trust fund at a rate not match the dollar come in .\nThis decreased direct financing for the Medicare HI trust fund through payroll tax , at least for the short term .\nSocial Security and Medicare be still go bankrupt .\nAt it current pace , Medicare will go bankrupt in 2026 ( the same a last year \u2019 s projection ) and the Social Security Trust Funds for old-aged benefit and disability benefit will become exhaust by 2034 .\nThe report estimate that the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be bankrupt by 2026 .\nThe solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance trust fund , out of which Part A benefit be pay , be a common way of measure Medicare \u2019 s financial status , though because it only focus on the status of Part A , it do not present a complete picture of total program spending .\nThis matter because when spend exceed income and the asset be fully deplete , Medicare will not have sufficient fund to pay hospital and other provider for all Part A benefit that be provide in a give year .\nFor example , in 2021 , the Medicare actuary estimate that the HI trust fund would begin the year with $ 185 billion in asset , but because spending be estimate to exceed revenue by $ 15 billion this year , the trust fund be expect to end the year with $ 170 billion in asset ( Figure 2 ) .\nBy 2025 , asset in the trust fund at the beginning of the year will have decrease to $ 73 billion , and with $ 50 billion more in spending than in revenue that year , asset will drop to $ 23 billion by the end of 2025 .\nIn the 2020 Medicare Trustees report , the actuary project that asset in the Part A trust fund will be deplete in 2026 , just five year from now ( Figure 3 ) .\nA more recent projection from the Congressional Budget Office also estimate depletion of the HI trust fund in 2026 .\nWhile some describe the trust fund a head toward \u201c bankruptcy \u201d or \u201c go break \u201d , it be important to note that the Medicare program will not cease to operate if asset be fully deplete , because revenue will continue flow into the fund from payroll tax and other source .\nHowever , there be no automatic process in place or precedent to determine how to apportion the available fund or how to fill the shortfall .\nMedicare Trustees Report Reaffirms that Medicare be Going Broke Report show Medicare \u2019 s hospital trust fund will run out of money in just five year Arlington , Va .\nLike last year \u2019 s trustee forecast and the one before it , the late report project that Medicare \u2019 s hospital trust fund will run out of money by 2026 .\nDon \u2019 t shoot the messenger , but the Trustees project that the Medicare hospital trust fund will run dry in 2026 .\nThat mean there win \u2019 t be enough money in the trust fund to fully pay hospital , doctor , and nursing home for the care they provide to Medicare beneficiary .\nBefore the Covid-19 pandemic , Medicare trustee have project that the trust fund would become insolvent in 2026 .\nNotably , neither candidate for president have mention the Medicare trust fund , much less how they would solidify Medicare \u2019 s future .\nPerhaps that be because while Medicare be an important issue for voter , there be a limited number of option for address the trust fund \u2019 s solvency , none of which be easy choice during normal time , much less during a recession with an ongoing pandemic .\nThe Trustees project the trust fund will be deplete by 2026 , the same year they project in their prior ( pre-COVID ) report .\nHealth saving and trust fund solution be need to slow cost growth and ensure Medicare continue to pay full benefit .\nThe Hospital Insurance Trust Fund Will Be Insolvent in 2026 Medicare Part A , which pay for inpatient hospital service , be finance mostly from a payroll tax through the HI trust fund .\nConclusion The Medicare Trustees \u2019 report show the HI trust fund will be insolvent by 2026 and Medicare spending will rise rapidly a a share of GDP over the next quarter-century .\nWithout action in the next five year , Medicare payment from the trust fund would be abruptly and indiscriminately reduce or delay , lead to a potential loss of access to care for enrollee .\nMedPage Today Medicare Action Needed to Forestall Medicare Hospital Trust Fund Insolvency , Experts Say `` The sooner we act , the good off we all be `` Joyce Frieden , Washington Editor , MedPage Today September 1 , 2021 WASHINGTON -- The estimate for when the Medicare hospital insurance fund become insolvent -- 2026 -- have not change over the past year , but more still need to be do to forestall that result , expert say Wednesday .\nAfter that , the trustee project deficit in all future year until the trust fund become deplete in 2026 , `` the report say .\nThe United States be run out of time to save the Medicare trust fund a the time frame to exhaustion have become compress .\nThe effect have be a depletion of the trust fund at fast than expect rate .\nWith the trust fund now expect to be deplete in 2024 , these next year will be a crucial juncture for Medicare .\nConclusion The trust fund \u2019 s potential exhaustion represent a significant threat to the Medicare program .\nWhile the coronavirus pandemic have significantly affect short-term spending in Medicare , it should n't have a large impact on the financial status of the program 's trust fund after 2024 , accord to the Medicare Board of Trustees ' annual report to Congress .\nTo date , lawmaker have not allow the Medicare trust fund to become depleted , though watchdog and deficit hawk warn the situation be get increasingly precarious .\nMedicare trustee project hospital fund to run out in 2026 , same deadline a year before .\n( Getty/zimmytws ) Medicare \u2019 s insurance trust fund that pay hospital be expect to run out of money in 2026 , the same projection a last year , accord to a new report from Medicare \u2019 s board of trustee .\n\u201d \u201c After that , the trustee project deficit in all future year until the trust fund become deplete in 2026 , \u201d the report add .\nFor Medicare , there have be notable impact on short-term financing and spending pattern , but these be expect to play out by 2024 and the Trustees project little effect on the actuarial balance of the Medicare trust fund .\nStill , the program \u2019 s dwindle trust fund need to be address Current projection put the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund only five year away from insolvency \u2014 the same estimated time frame that be project before the pandemic According to recent projection , the Medicare Hospital Insurance ( HI ) Trust Fund , absent congressional action , will become insolvent in 2026 and no longer be able to fully cover the cost of beneficiary \u2019 hospital bill .\nWhile many fear the pandemic would have a catastrophic impact on Medicare \u2019 s solvency , the net effect seem to be small relative to the amount need to change the life of the trust fund .\nBecause of how Medicare be structure , add dental , vision and hearing coverage would have little impact on the trust fund that 's forecast to be insolvent begin in 2026 .\nIn simple term , it 's the Part A trust fund that be face a shortfall beginning in 2026 , accord to the late trustee report .\nShots - Health News With million of people out of work because of the coronavirus pandemic , few payroll tax be come in to help keep Medicare 's trust fund intact .\nIn April , Medicare 's trustee report that the Part A trust fund , which pay for hospital and other inpatient care , would start to run out of money in 2026 .\nGiven even a conservative estimate of how many worker and business would not be contribute payroll tax that finance Part A spending , he say , the trust fund could become insolvent a early a 2022 or 2023 .\n( Medicare Part B , which pay physician and other outpatient cost , be fund by beneficiary premium and general tax funding , so it can not technically become insolvent .\nThere be one other coronavirus-related policy that could hasten the depletion of the trust fund .\nMost budget expert think that Medicare would reimburse hospital and other Part A providers 100 % of their claim until the fund literally run out of money , and then would pay claim only a more money flow in .\nThe Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will have sufficient fund to pay full benefit until 2026 , accord to the late annual report release Aug .\n\u201c While the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly affect Medicare short-term financing and spending , it be not expect to have a large effect on the financial status of the trust fund after 2024 , \u201d the report note .\nIts giant trust fund for inpatient care win \u2019 t be able to fully cover project medical bill start at that point .\nWhile trust fund estimate show that Medicare face some financial challenge , Medicare be not \u201c go broke .\nEven if the Part A ( Hospital Insurance ) trust fund be to become insolvent in 2026 , a currently project , Medicare would still continue to be able to cover more than 90 percent of total ( all Parts ) cost throughout the long-range projection period of 75 year .\nMedicare have face projection of insolvency for the Part A trust fund throughout it history , but have always remain solvent .\nAs in the past , incremental adjustment can strengthen Medicare \u2019 s trust fund solvency and enable the program to continue protect the people who rely on it today and in the future .",

    "evidence": "19-840 , be bring by Republican official who say the mandate require insurance become unconstitutional after Congress in 2017 eliminate the penalty for fail to obtain health insurance because it could no longer be justify a a tax .\n\u201d Indeed , when the early challenge to the health care law be argue in 2012 , the Obama administration do say that the mandate could not be sever from two related provision , one prohibit insurer from turn away applicant and the other bar them from take account of pre-existing condition .\nPeople must pay a tax if they fail to carry approved health insurance .\nIn combination , these two legislative step , each doubtlessly constitutional , would have do precisely what seven member of the Court decide the Affordable Care Act could not dotell state that if they do not extend coverage a specify in the Affordable Care Act , they would lose current Medicaid funding .\nAnd , because the Affordable Care Act describe the financial charge impose on those without proper insurance a a penalty impose for violate a law that Congress lack the power to legislate , that be the end of the story .\nBut while many Americans may be more protect now from financial catastrophe if they get sick or injure than they be before the ACA , the law do not solve all the problem that ail US health care , and it continue survival be no guarantee that they win \u2019 t get bad .\nPeople who make an economic decision to forego health insurance do not opt out of the health care market , but instead shift their cost to others when they become ill or be involve in an accident and can not pay .\nRegulations arise from the ACA require many employer to include free coverage for contraceptive service in their employee \u2019 health insurance plan .\nAs for RFRA \u2019 s requirement that the mandate be enforce in the least restrictive way possible , the government argue that any alternative to the insurance mandate would mean upend the ACA \u2019 s health care model ( which revolve around employment-based health insurance ) and replace it with something different , a highly impractical option , accord to the government .\nThe decision come after three day of historic argument in late March that hinge on whether the government can require people to purchase health insurance , if they 're not otherwise cover .\nThe Affordable Care Act , include it individual mandate that virtually all Americans buy health insurance , be constitutional .\nThere be not five vote to uphold it on the ground that Congress could use it power to regulate commerce between the state to require everyone to buy health insurance .\nCalifornia and the House continue to argue that the mandate be best read not a a command to purchase health insurance but a a legal choice to purchase coverage .\nHawkins respond that government can adopt hortatory statement but that the mandate , especially through it use of the word shall , be more than hortatory and impose a legal requirement to purchase health insurance .\nRecap of the controversial case The case center on the individual mandate , the part of the law that compel Americans to purchase health insurance or pay a fee .\nSebelius that a crucial provision of Obamacare the `` individual mandate `` to purchase health insurance be unconstitutional .\nIn short , if Congress pass a bill deal with an issue that the Constitution do not expressly give it `` legislative power `` to address such a health insurance Congress be unconstitutionally arrogate power to itself .\nYet Obamacare 's supporter will argue that the health-care law address a national crisis lack of access to health care much great than the danger of sexual predation .\nAnd how be it `` proper `` to divert regulation of health care and insurance from the state and local government that be more accountable and responsive to the American people ? .\nThe ACA be also design to protect consumer from insurance company tactic that might drive up patient cost or restrict care .\nSome people think it \u2019 s intrusive for the government to require health insurance .\nOn January 31 , 2011 , Judge Roger Vinson rule that the mandatory health insurance `` individual mandate `` \u2014the provision of Internal Revenue Code section 5000A impose a `` shared responsibility penalty `` on nearly all Americans who fail to purchase health insurance\u2014was outside the power of Congress .\n34 Here the Court conclude that `` [ a ] tax on go without health insurance do not fall within any recognized category of direct tax .\nIn this case , however , it be reasonable to construe what Congress have do a increase tax on those who have a certain amount of income , but choose to go without health insurance .\nIs not the power to compel purchase of health insurance much less ? .\nHe then refer to the Court hold that the ACA 's requirement that state rapidly extend Medicaid coverage to new beneficiary or lose exist federal payment be unduly coercive by note that the court find that `` such a threat be coercive and that the state can not be penalize for not expand their Medicaid coverage after receive fund .\nFor example , 56 % of Americans ( a of February 2012 ) deem that Congress do not have the legal right to require everyone to have health insurance , while 34 % believe that such a mandate be legally permissible .\nhealth care system that President Obama sign into law Tuesday , argue the law 's requirement that individual buy health insurance violate the Constitution .",

funding .\nCity of Chicago In June 2010 , a Chicago law that ban handgun be strike down .\nThe White House claim that Chicago have a high crime rate despite it strict gun law .\nPointing to Chicago to suggest that gun law do n't work be not a new talk point \u2014 Trump claim Chicago have `` the tough gun law in the United States `` in a 2016 presidential debate ; his fellow Republican candidate Chris Christie likewise point to Chicago a a place with high crime despite tight gun law .\nBut while gun violence in Chicago be high , the rest of this common talk point do n't really hold water .\nHigh crime and tough gun law It 's also true that there be more than 4,000 shoot victim in Chicago in 2016 .\n'Enough Is Enough ' It be true that Illinois have tough gun law than many other state .\nBut it 's not true that Chicago have the strict gun law in the country .\nAt one point , it do have much tough law \u2014 it have ban handgun in the city limit , but a 2008 Supreme Court rule declare that ban unconstitutional , and a 2010 ruling reaffirm that .\nState line do n't stop gun It 's important to remember here that Chicago be very close to two state that have relatively weak gun law .\nNeither Wisconsin nor Indiana require license or permit to purchase a gun , for example , nor do they require wait period .\nBy comparison , 82 percent of gun recover in Indiana and trace be from within Indiana , suggest that criminal in that state do n't have to cross state line , like those in Illinois , to get their weapon .\n`` No one 's in a position to say that Chicago 's various special regulation and Illinois 's regulation be do no good , `` he say , `` because we do n't know what the homicide rate would be in the absence of those .\nIn fact , city with some of the most stringent gun law , like New York and Chicago , suffer from some of the high violent crime rate .\nShooting and murder rate in Chicago surge 50 % in 2020 , and that city record the high number of gun-related homicide on record .\nAnti-violence advocate and Lightfoot administration official see state-mandated gun control a one important remedy for the violence , but they also say Chicagos geographic location limit the effectiveness of legislative reform .\nIllinois already rank above average when it come to state with the strong gun law , but the street of Chicago be still flood with thousand of weapon every year .\nSome prominent gun violence researcher have call into question the public health framework , say it tend to minimize the important role that the criminal justice system play in prevent shooting by arrest and convict the people who commit them .\nAnalysis reveal that universal background check , permit requirement , may issue law ( where local authority have discretion in approve who can carry a concealed weapon ) , and law ban people convict of violent misdemeanor from possess firearm be , individually and collectively , significantly able to reduce gun-related death .\nWe have background check , permit requirement , may issue law where local police have lot of discretion in approve who can carry a concealed weapon , and a law that prevent most people convict of a violent misdemeanor from carry a weapon .\nDespite what the president claim , Chicago do not have \u201c the strong gun law in our nation .\nThey also note that Chicago , which have strict law than most city , be border by state that have relatively lax gun law .\nI mean , you look at the city with the strong gun law in our nation , be Chicago , and Chicago be a disaster , Trump say during a press conference in Korea on Nov .\nIn Chicago , which have the tough gun law in the United States , probably you could say by far , they have more gun violence than any other city .\nI think if you look to Chicago , where you have over 4,000 victim of gun-related crime last year , they have the strict gun law in the country , Sanders say .\nChicago do have strong municipal law , but we wouldnt say it have the strong gun law in the country , because the strong regulation in Chicago have be largely implement by entire state , include New York and California , Hannah Shearer , a staff attorney and Second Amendment litigation director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence , tell u via email .\nIn contrast , the state of Illinois have significantly weak law than New York and California , include a shall-issue concealed carry permit system .\nA few state border Chicago , such a Indiana , have extremely weak gun law .\nStill , the report suggest that many of the gun use in Chicago crime come from outside the city water down the effectiveness that any local gun law might have .\nAs for the president \u2019 s implication that stricter gun law either don \u2019 t work or lead to high rate of homicide , study suggest that \u2019 s not the case .\nIt \u2019 s mislead for Trump to cite Chicago a evidence that gun control law don \u2019 t reduce gun violence .\nChicago no longer have \u201c the strong gun law in our nation , \u201d and it doesn \u2019 t have nearly the high homicide rate among major city .\nChicago , Illinois In 2015 , Chicago have the high total number of gun homicide of any city in America .\nDonald Trump have spend month decry the historic spike in gun violence in Chicago , most recently suggest on Twitter that if Chicago \u2019 s \u201c Mayor ca n't do it he must ask for Federal help .\nCHICAGO \u2014 Amid an impeachment inquiry in Washington and an ongoing strike by more than 32,000 teacher and school staff , President Donald Trump be likely to make his first presidential visit to Chicago on Monday , a city that he often ridicule for how it leader handle gun violence .\n`` There 's no reason for what 's go

In Chicago , which have the tough gun law in the United States , probably you could say by far , they have more gun violence than any other city , `` Trump say in a 2016 presidential debate \u2014 a claim that he have since repeat .\nWhat about Chicago 's 'toughest gun law ' in the nation ? .\nExperts say that while Chicago be among the state with stricter gun law , it 's not the most restrictive .\nBut gun right advocate still view Illinois a have very restrictive gun law .\nIllinois have strong gun law than the majority of the country and the 16th-lowest gun death rate .\nLearn more about

    "input": "We lowered the business tax from 4 percent down to 1 percent.",
    "evidence": "Given that the economy grow in 2018 , and in the absence of another policy that could have cause a large revenue loss , the data imply that the 2017 tax cut substantially reduce revenue .\nEven take into account that other economic factor , such a change in trade policy and a global economic slowdown , may have hold investment down , these data suggest that the stimulus provide by the tax reform be not large .\nContrary to the expectation of some observer , the permanent cut in the corporate tax rate may have hold investment down rather than stimulate it .\nAs company expand their borrowing and investment , the present value of their tax liability decrease , make investment cheap .\nIf the tax system do not allow any interest deductibility or accelerate depreciation , a corporate income tax would raise the user cost of capital .\nThe result that a cut in the corporate tax rate decrease investment can be mitigate or overturn by a mechanism work through the borrowing rate face by corporation .\nUnlike the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts cut in the corporate tax rate , the act transitional provision on corporate earnings hold overseas likely stimulate investment .\nOther Provisions Besides the corporate tax cut , the other tax-reform provision that have the most important effect on investment be the tax cut for individual and pass-through business , the increase in the first-year bonus depreciation , the scheduled amortization of R & D expense , and the limit on interest deductibility .\nThe tax cut for owner of pass-through business have effect similar to the one of the corporate tax cut , a describe earlier .\nOn the one hand , for these business , the cut in the income tax rate may have hold their investment down .\nOn the other hand , the tax cut decrease the credit risk for pass-through business , their credit spread , and borrow rate , lead to a low user cost of capital and a high investment level .\nThe net effect depend on the decline in the borrowing rate for pass-through business .\nIn the macroeconomic model that we use in this article , the borrowing rate do not decline much , so the tax cut for pass-through business end up decrease investment .\nWhen draft the tax law , lawmaker could have eliminate special break and loophole in the corporate tax to offset the cost of reduce the statutory rate .\nLimit the ability of tech and other company to use executive stock option to reduce their tax by generate \u201c cost \u201d that far exceed what company actually incur .\nTCJA include provision that dramatically cut tax and provision that offset a fraction of the revenue loss by eliminate or limit certain tax break .\nOther special break allow company to reduce their tax liability after they apply the rate to their taxable income .\nThe difference in tax rate between company , even within the same industry , demonstrate how loophole in our tax code can create huge economic distortion by give some company a tax advantage over their competitor .\n\u201d [ 4 ] Combined with rule allow corporation to deduct interest expense , accelerate depreciation can result in very low , or even negative , tax rate on profit from particular investment .\nCorporations deduct the value of stock option just a they deduct the value of any compensation to employee , but the tax rule make this particular form of compensation a golden opportunity for tax avoidance .\nThe problem be that when a corporation deduct that value for tax purpose , they calculate it in a way that generate a much large figure than the actual cost to the corporation , which they report to investor .\nUnlike the accounting rule , the tax rule allow the company to wait until the employee exercise the option , which could be several year later , and claim a tax deduction equal to the value of the stock option at that time , which can be much large than the value report to investor .\nbe entirely due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate , because other pro-growth provision be schedule to expire .\n[ 7 ] Conversely , low the corporate income tax incentivizes new investment , lead to an increase of the capital stock .\nA corporate tax rate that be more in line with our competitor reduce the incentive for firm to realize their profit in lower-tax jurisdiction and encourage company to invest in the United States .\nRaising the corporate income tax rate would reduce economic growth , and lead to a small capital stock , low wage growth , and reduced employment .\nGiven the positive economic effect of a low corporate tax rate , lawmaker should avoid view the corporate income tax a a potential source of raise additional revenue .\nEconomic evidence indicate that it be worker who bear the final burden of the corporate income tax , and that corporate income tax be the most harmful for economic growth\u2014raising this tax rate be not advisable .\nThis indicate that the income inequality that exist before the levying of state and local tax have be make bad by those tax .\nProperty tax , include both tax on individual and business tax , be usually somewhat regressive .\n12 The growth of pass-through business have also contribute to the erosion of the payroll tax base , which fund the Social Security , Disability , and Medicare trust fund .\nThe grow share of income accrue to limited partner , LLCs , and others that file a partnership and to S-corporations erode the payroll tax base because those entity be either statutorily exclude from the payroll base or a lack of clarity in the law allow owner to avoid the tax .\nRevenues from corporate tax have generally be decline a a share of GDP , in part a a result of low tax rate and the increase in the prevalence of pass-through business .\nThose tax expenditures include reduce tax rate for income from a corporation \u2019 s foreign subsidiary , as well a the tax deduction for pass-through entity mention above .\nAs the government reduce statutory tax rate , especially for those at the top , inequality explode , and income growth rate go down .\nThis be despite the long and sustained fall in tax revenue , which begin drop in 2017 a corporation use account technique to ensure loss would start appear the year before the new rate hit to take full advantage of the cut .\nLower tax rate do not boost growth and job Conservatives claim reduce the corporate tax rate will substantially grow the economy .\nAmericans dont want to cut corporate tax Recent polling show that the public feel strongly that corporation need to step up and contribute their fair share .\nFirst , slash the corporate tax rate would increase corporation \u2019 after-tax return on investment , induce them to massively boost spending on investment such a factory , equipment , and research and development .\nTherefore , a new corporate tax cut would , even if effective , likely be pass onto shareholder rather than be reinvested by the firm receive the tax cut .\nCritics emphasize far that even if the tax cut spark an investment boom that increase productivity , it would be far from clear whether worker would be able to capture the gain , give the power imbalance between U .\nThe promised boom in business investment never happen In the year follow the tax cut , business investment increased\u2014but not by nearly as much a the tax cut proponent \u2019 prediction would have imply .\n\u201d Moreover , investment in housing have decline every quarter since the passage of the tax legislation .\nWhat we do know , however , be that nearly two year after the tax bill pa , the investment boom that be suppose to justify the corporate tax cuts\u2014and even pay for those tax cut over the long run\u2014simply have not happen .\nfirm to access profit that have be \u201c trap \u201d overseas by the old international tax system , enable them to invest more in the United States .\nThe ballyhooed tax cut bonus be a mirage Finally , recent data show that the tax bill do not lead to a meaningful increase in worker bonus , debunk the forceful public relation campaign wag by the proponent of the tax cut and the corporation receive them .\nNow that this method of tax planning be no longer available , employer have reduce the value of bonus , which have now fall low than their pre-TCJA levels\u2014showing that the much-hyped benefit for worker be illusory .\n\u201d Much of this tax reform concern the corporate income tax , and the conventional wisdom in this debate be that the goal of reform should be revenue-neutral change that broaden the base and low the tax rate .\nThe analysis find no evidence that high corporate tax rate have a negative impact on economic growth ( i .\n, it find no evidence that change in either the statutory corporate tax rate or the effective marginal tax rate on capital income be correlate with economic growth ) .\nOthers argue for simple rate reduction ( and corporate tax revenue reduction ) or even outright elimination of the corporate income tax .\nDownload image The statutory corporate tax rate , however , do not necessarily capture the tax burden on new investment ( Gravelle 1994 ) .\nIt be possible that the corporate tax rate affect economic growth with a lag .\nThe justification for low the corporate tax rate be that it will increase economic growth .",

.\nIts effect be very difficult to pinpoint , and the National Academy of Sciences have conclude that past study have neither prove nor disproven a deterrent effect .\nEhrlich conclude that `` In light of these observation , one can not reject the hypothesis that punishment , in general , and execution , in particular , exert a unique deterrent effect on potential murderer .\nOn the other hand , there be also anecdotal evidence that some homicide may have be deter by the death penalty .\nSome argue that use of the death penalty be a response to , but not a cause of , high murder rate , while some maintain that it have a brutalize effect on society that increase the incidence of murder by instill a low regard for human life .\nThose who believe that deterrence justify the execution of certain offender bear the burden of prove that the death penalty be a deterrent .\nHarm Reduction International `` The low rate of effectiveness of law enforcement , the relative immunity from the law of those who profit most from the trade in drug , and the high risk of violence and death they most probably run from others engage in the drug trade , all make it seem implausible that the death penalty in itself will have a marginally strong deterrent effect than long term of imprisonment , especially when .\nBut people believe a hypothesis to be true do not actually make that hypothesis true , which be why a survey of opinion be insufficient in prove any claim about the death penalty \u2019 s effect on crime .\nThere be a variety of factor that have an effect on whether people commit crime ; these include , but be not limit to , variable like socio-economic circumstance , education , psychosocial disability , and effectiveness of law enforcement .\nAlthough it be commonly think that the death penalty be reserve for those who commit the most heinous crime , in reality only a small percentage of death-sentenced inmate be convict of unusually vicious crime .\nOne can not study the impact of execution when they be hardly ever impose , and it be difficult to separate any impact of the death penalty from the large number of other factor that affect the amount and kind of crime .\nresearch have fail to provide scientific proof that execution have a great deterrent effect than life imprisonment .\nThe death penalty be a harsh punishment , but it be not harsh on crime .\nOne of the key justification for the use of the death penalty be that it deter crime .\nWhile the evidence from the United States suggest that the death penalty do not have a detrimental effect on crime rate , it be possible these result may not be applicable to the rest of the world .\nOne of the lead justification for the use of the death penalty be that it deter crime .\nWe protect vulnerable people face execution , include people with mental illness who be uniquely at risk , and we produce report about capital punishment and the way in which public safety can be undermine by rely on this expensive and flawed punishment .\nThe same factor drive wrongful conviction in non-capital case and death penalty case , include .\nHowever , he , like others who support the death penalty , can produce no evidence to support this claim .\nQuite simply , rigorous analysis of the available data do not support the claim make for the need to retain the death penalty to reduce social harm .\nKey Issues Many people have strongly hold view on the deterrent effect of the death penalty .\nTo argue for the deterrent effect of the death penalty in such way a because the death penalty increase the price of murder , there will be less of it be to gloss over critical element of understand how it might work .\nThus , provide the legal authority for the use of the death penalty for a special class of murder might prevent murder of that type by make clear that these type of murder be deem particularly heinous .\nIf the probability of apprehension be correlate with the imposition of the death penalty , a finding that the death penalty seemingly deter murder might actually reflect police effectiveness in deter murder .",

Before human begin burn fossil fuel , naturally occur greenhouse gas help to make Earth \u2019 s climate habitable .\neven with new technology I choose this link because of a comment make regard the use of carbon dioxide a a refrigerant , allege that this fact make climate change due to gas like CO2 highly unlikely .\nMost climate scientist be convince , base on greenhouse-warming theory , that this warm be cause primarily by increased burning of fossil fuel , cause increase emission of greenhouse gas , that be absorb increase amount of infrared radiation emit by Earth .\nWhy the Physics of Greenhouse-Warming Theory Appears to Be Mistaken Greenhouse-warming theory , accord to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , posit that greenhouse gas , primarily water vapor ( H2O ) , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , nitrous oxide ( N2O ) , methane ( CH4 ) and ozone ( O3 ) \u201c absorb terrestrial radiation emit by Earth \u2019 s surface and elsewhere in the atmosphere .\nClimate scientist calculate radiative forcings , which be the net change in flux ( downward minus upward ) cause by change in concentration in the atmosphere of each type of greenhouse gas , dust , black carbon soot , smoke from biomass burning , aerosol , volcanic aerosol , contrail , and such , or cause by any change in radiation from Sun .\nThe question before u concern the nature , extent and rate of global warming that have be observe and how human emission of greenhouse gas figure into these observation .\nI would like to learn about the limit of our ability to attribute greenhouse gas emission to global warming and what be need to improve that ability .\nToday we will examine the scientific question of whether greenhouse gas emission from human activity be contribute and will continue to contribute to a warming of this planet .\nThe IPCC find that the warming of the climate system be unequivocal and that most of the observed increase in globally average temperature since the mid-20th century be very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission .\nThey explain that some of these factor be important for local temperature but that the only explanation for the large increase in global temperature be the greenhouse gas which we be add to the atmosphere .\nOn the central question of man 's contribution to the increase of global temperature due to greenhouse gas emission , however , the issue be clear .\nToday we be focus on the threshold question of the extent to which greenhouse gas emission from human activity be cause an increase in global temperature .\nChairman , I hope that the member will use this opportunity to ask tough question and to seek answer for any uncertainty they may have about the science of climate change .\nForcings impose on the climate system can be natural in origin such a change in solar luminosity or volcanic eruption or human-induced such a the buildup of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere .\nClimate model simulation that account for such change in climate forcings have now show that surface warming of recent decade be mainly a response to the increase concentration of greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosol in the atmosphere .\nBecause of the very long lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the slow equilibration of the ocean , there be a substantial future commitment to far global climate change even if concentration of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere remain at current level .\nClimate model incorporate our best understanding of how the climate system work and drive with observed change in radiative force such a change in greenhouse gas , aerosol , volcanic and solar forcing reproduce the 20th century temperature record quite well .\nCarefully investigate alternative physical explanation for the observed warming , we come to the conclusion that it be very likely that most of the observed warming be cause by the greenhouse gas increase .\nClimate respond substantially to change in radiative forcings such a change in greenhouse gas .\nThe second question , if global temperature increase , to what extent be the increase attribute to greenhouse gas emission from human activity be where I start have slightly different opinion and so the question , how do we expect the future global temperature to be affect by greenhouse gas .\nI believe that in spite of the fact that the model be an essential tool to be able to evaluate the climate and be probably the only good tool that we can have to speculate about what be go to happen in the future climate , there be still a lot of uncertainty in these model , and because of those uncertainty and the way that they be build , we have difficulty to estimate exactly what be the proportion of the greenhouse gas contribution to the overall climate versus many other activity that be take place from the human activity .\nIn these and other data set , we find inconsistency between observation and the output of climate model which try to tell u the climate effect of greenhouse gas .\nThe IPCC also find that -- and again I quote from the report -- `` Continued greenhouse gas emission at or above current rate would cause further warming and induce many change in the global climate system during the 21st century that would very likely be large than those that be observe during the 20th century .\nConcentrations of greenhouse gas have vary substantially during Earth \u2019 s history , and these variation have drive substantial climate change at a wide range of timescales .\nThe Carbon Dioxide Greenhouse Effect In the 19th century , scientist realize that gas in the atmosphere cause a `` greenhouse effect `` which affect the planet 's temperature .\nThey find that the gas play a crucial role in climate change , so that the rise level could gravely affect our future .\nit be a mistake to dismiss the greenhouse effect with spectroscopic argument .\nSubscribe Now Study the effect of increase concentration of carbon dioxide on Earth 's atmosphere and plant lifeAn overview of the role greenhouse gas play in modify Earth 's climate .\nBuildup of greenhouse gas One problem that be bring about by human action and be definitely affect the hydrosphere globally be that of the greenhouse gas ( so call because of their heat-trapping \u201c greenhouse \u201d property ) emit to the atmosphere .\nThus , the greenhouse effect , which be essential for create the climate for life on Earth , be also responsible for the Earth get warm than it be before we start burn large amount of fossil fuel .\nBecause many of the major greenhouse gas stay in the atmosphere for ten to hundred of year after be release , their warm effect on the climate persist over a long time and can therefore affect both present and future generation .\nOur assessment of the future risk from the continue build up of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere be even less informed by 20th century change in global mean temperature .\nBack on Earth , that fundamental understanding of the physic of radiation , combine with our understanding of climate change from the geological record , clearly demonstrate that increase greenhouse gas concentration will inevitably drive global warming .\nThese fingerprint show the entire climate system have change in way that be consistent with increase greenhouse gas and an enhanced greenhouse effect .\nOn their climate home page , the National Academies of Sciences , Engineering , and Medicines say , `` Scientists have know for some time , from multiple line of evidence , that human be change Earth \u2019 s climate , primarily through greenhouse gas emission , `` and that `` Climate change be increasingly affect people \u2019 s life .\n`` Scientific evidence indicate that the lead cause of climate change in the most recent half century be the anthropogenic increase in the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gas , include carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , chlorofluorocarbon , methane , tropospheric ozone , and nitrous oxide .\nSince greenhouse gas occur naturally , how do we know they \u2019 re cause Earth \u2019 s temperature to rise ? .\nFor more than a century , scientist have understand the basic physic behind why greenhouse gas like carbon dioxide cause warming .\nThis be actually part of how we know that greenhouse gas have the ability to significantly affect Earth \u2019 s temperature .\nRead on to get the answer to the most common question and understand fully why greenhouse gas be a problem .\nHowever , carbon dioxide be the most prevalent of all greenhouse gas , which be one of the reason it come up so frequently when discus climate change issue .\nEvery greenhouse gas have a corresponding Global Warming Potential ( GWP ) to reflect how long it stay in the air and how aggressively it absorb energy .\nLong-lived gas that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to change in temperature be describe a `` force `` climate change .\nThe most abundant greenhouse gas , but importantly , it act a a feedback to the climate .\nClimate model that include solar irradiance change cant reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without include a rise in greenhouse gas .\nThe most troubling part be that it stick around in the atmosphere for hundred of year , make climate change not just a problem for u now , but generation well into the future .\nThe high concentration of greenhouse gasesand carbon dioxide in particularis cause extra heat to be trap and global temperature to rise .\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , these be the broad forcings that drive nearly all human-caused greenhouse gas emission .\nFueled by man-made greenhouse gas emission , global warming be alter the earths climate system in many way .\nFor just a the emission of man-made greenhouse gas long ago be induce the climate change we see now , the emission we release today will impact u long into the future .\nSince atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gas be constantly change , the temperature measure at any time be the `` transient `` temperature , which lag behind the committed equilibrium warming .\nThis estimate account for atmospheric chemistry , atmospheric lifetime of the gas , and other relevant factor affect the total contribution of that gas to greenhouse warming .\nBecause greenhouse gas have relatively long lifetime in the atmosphere , and because of lag in the response of the system , their effect build up over time .\nThe mechanism that play a significant role in the response of the climate to change concentration of greenhouse gas need further identification , and quantification at scale appropriate for climate model .\nThe book present method for as option to reduce emission of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere , offset emission , and assist human and unmanaged system of plant and animal to adjust to the consequence of global warming .\nMany climate scientist be now convince that the rise be likely to continue a greenhouse gas accumulate .\nHow the climate would actually change now depend chiefly on what policy humanity would choose for it greenhouse gas emission .\nEarth \u2019 s temperature be a balance act The greenhouse effect cause the atmosphere to retain heat Changes in the sun \u2019 s energy affect how much energy reach Earth \u2019 s system Changes in reflectivity affect how much energy enters Earth \u2019 s system Earth 's temperature be a balance act Models that account only for the effect of natural process be not able to explain the warm observe over the past century .\nModels that also account for the greenhouse gas emit by human be able to explain this warming .\nVariations in the sun 's energy reach Earth Changes in the reflectivity of Earth \u2019 s atmosphere and surface Changes in the greenhouse effect , which affect the amount of heat retain by Earth \u2019 s atmosphere These factor have cause Earth \u2019 s climate to change many time .\nIn general , climate change prior to the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s can be explain by natural cause , such a change in solar energy , volcanic eruption , and natural change in greenhouse gas ( GHG ) concentration .\nBecause water vapor be a greenhouse gas , this lead to further warming .\nThe recent role of the greenhouse effect Since the Industrial Revolution begin around 1750 , human activity have contribute substantially to climate change by add CO2 and other heat-trapping gas to the atmosphere .\nWarming from greenhouse gas emission , as well a other human change to the Earth system may increase the possibility of large and abrupt regional or global climatic event .\nHowever , too many greenhouse gas can cause the temperature to increase out of control .\nThe result be call Global Warming because on average , the Earth and our ocean be warm up , and climate be change a the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas in the atmosphere continue to build up .\ncom ) Behind the phenomenon of global warming and climate change lie the increase in greenhouse gas in our atmosphere .\nBy increase the heat in the atmosphere , greenhouse gas be responsible for the greenhouse effect , which ultimately lead to global warming .\nHow greenhouse gas cause global warmingThe gas in the atmosphere that absorb radiation be know a `` greenhouse gas `` ( abbreviate a GHG ) because they be largely responsible for the greenhouse effect .",

implication for seasonal change in ice cover , weather and the food supply .\nPhoto courtesy of NOAA 's Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab Anderson say there \u2019 s `` no doubt `` a connection exist between climate change and the lake \u2019 s response to rise air temperature and other factor .\nThe change in heat content and temperature of the lake can also have a huge impact on weather and regional climate , accord to Drew Gronewold , one of the study \u2019 s co-authors and associate professor with the University of Michigan 's School for Environment and Sustainability .\n`` Things like lake effect snow that be a function of wind and moisture move across the surface of the lake , those be all in the long term affect by not just what 's at the surface , but how heat be exchange below the surface , and then back and forth between the bottom and the surface , `` say Gronewold .\n`` So , the change in the heat content and temperature of the lake be a big , big part of understand first and foremost , evaporation , `` he say .\nThe finding illustrate the impact that climate change can pose for the world \u2019 s 10 large lake that provide 84 percent of the Earth \u2019 s surface freshwater .\n`` That support drinking water and economy and all kind of thing that live in the lake \u2019 s ecology , and what we 've see with this study be that those system be change , `` say Anderson .\nWe could see even more dramatic swing in water level thanks to climate change .\nMore than a century of hydraulic and hydrological data on the Great Lakes , collect by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , show u that evaporation and precipitation ( snow , rain , hail , and those lovely wintry mix ) dictate how high or low the lake get , and we \u2019 re now see more extreme weather event that influence both of those process .\nTypically , water level begin to rise in the spring when rain fall on the lake or trickle in from the land and when snowmelt flood the tributary that empty into the lake .\nThat pattern be consistent with climate change model that predict midwestern rainstorm drop more water over short time frame than in the past .\nIn 2013 , Lakes Michigan and Huron hit record low , and the others be well below average due to lower-than-normal rainfall and high air temperature that lead to more evaporation , two more consequence of climate change .\nBut of 235 lake study across six continent , the author of a 2015 paper find that Lake Superior be warm the fast , it temperature rise at three time the global rate , thanks to climate change .\nExtreme weather , sea level rise , and other climate change impact be increasingly to blame .\nResearchers report new evidence that water level in the Great Lakes , which be near record low level , may be shrink due to global warming .\nBut recent decline in water level have raise concern because the decline be consistent with many climate change projection , they say .\nResearchers in Michigan report new evidence that water level in the Great Lakes , which be near record low level , may be shrink due to global warming .\nBut recent decline in water level have raise concern because the decline be consistent with many climate change projection , they say .\nTo evaluate the factor behind this decline , the scientist examine water level data for Lakes Michigan and Huron from 1860 to 2006 , include precipitation , evaporation and runoff data .\n`` We can not be certain that the present observed water level drop be cause by factor relate to global climate change , or that it portend a long-term problem , `` the study state .\nBut the ongoing decline in water level make it `` prudent to include low lake level in future management planning , `` the researcher note .\n12 , 2021 A new study have show how climate change could impact the ecosystem of the planet 's large lake by reveal vary level at which their water layer be mix together through the season .\nDon Wuebbles , professor of atmospheric science at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognize expert on the Great Lakes , say climate change will affect shoreline community in various way , most notably rise and fall lake level due to change in precipitation and evaporation .\n\u201c Climate change have start push Lake Michigan \u2019 s water level toward uncharted territory a pattern of rain , snowfall and evaporation be transform by the warming world .\nNatural Influences on Water LevelsHydrologyThe water level of the Great Lakes be determine by the amount of water flow in and out of the lake .\nThis hydrologic cycle determines water supply to the Great Lakes Basin .\nConversely , consecutive warm and dry year will cause water level to decline .\nLong-term change in water level be usually a result of high or low precipitation ( rain and snow ) and evaporation rate .\nIn particular , Great Lakes water level be especially influence by winter .\na hard winter , with above normal snowfall and bitter cold temperature create vast ice cover will cause lake level to rise , whereas mild winter with high temperature and , subsequently , less ice cover and more evaporation will decrease lake level .\nHuman Influences on Water LevelsWhile climate and weather pattern be the primary driver of Great Lakes water level , there be other man-made force that also influence water level .\nSeveral human activity have affect level and flow of the Great Lakes over the year .\nIn addition to intentionally regulate water level , man-made alteration , include dredge , diversion , and water withdrawal , have unintended consequence to the water level of the Great Lakes .\nArmy Corps of Engineers lake level analysis , there be other indication that climate change be occur within the Great Lakes Basin .\nThe loss of Great Lakes ice have allow more water to evaporate in winter , result in heavy lake effect snow near the shore , and low lake level .\nThe loss of ice be due to increase air and water temperature .\nA team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison study the timing of ice break-ups on 61 lake in Minnesota , Wisconsin , Michigan , New York , and Ontario between 1975 and 2004 , during which time the average global air temperature rise by 0 .\nDue to decreased lake ice cover along with warmer-than-average weather , data show a long-term warming trend throughout the Great Lakes for water temperature .\nThe rise in temperature will cause lake water level to fall due to increased evapotranspiration , the water lose to the atmosphere by evaporation and transpiration .\nClair River part of the Study be establish to address widespread concern among government at all level , property owner , and other interest about the long term economic and environmental effect of low water level in the upper Great Lakes .\nThe maximum volume of Great Lakes water divert have change over the year .\nTherefore , the net total of all the inter-basin diversion in the Great Lakes show more water divert into the lake than out .\nThe rate of evaporation from the lake be dependent on a number of factor include wind speed , air temperature , water temperature , and ice cover .\nWhether or not water level will continue to drop be uncertain , he say , a be whether or not climate change be entirely responsible .\nHe say that factor such a warm temperature and decrease precipitation be present , but suggest that others could be at play as well , such a dredging and natural fluctuation in water level .\n`` The science be maybe a little early to fully understand fluctuation in order to fully identify climate change a a driver of this drop , but there be evidence of climate change over the last thirty or forty year that would lead you to expect these water level drop to occur , `` Dr .\n`` So if you ca n't conclude water level be go to be low forever , you 're not go to put in an expensive engineering project that would take a very long time .\nGlobal warming be increase evaporation of the Great Lakes , which could have a profound impact on transportation , industry , agriculture , and recreation in the Midwest .\nAs the Great Lakes warm , evaporation be increase more than the rain and snowmelt supply stream flow into the Great Lakes .\n2 The combination of warm lake water , rise air temperature , and diminish ice cover lead to more evaporation of lake water .\nProjections be difficult because scientist must take into account both warming-induced evaporation and warming-induced precipitation .\nRising lake level have cause significant damage throughout the Great Lakes , and expert say climate change be rapidly alter the shoreline .\nScientists say the only long-term solution , a climate change cause erosion and high high and low low in lake level , be to retreat from the shoreline .\nNot Enough Money Water level on the Great Lakes have begin fall ever so slightly , a they typically do during the fall , although erosion be likely to continue a winter storm pound the lakeshore .\nThese change be particularly pronounce over Earth \u2019 s large lakes10 ( which hold more than 90 percent of all global surface fresh water ) , where rapid increase in lake temperature11 have lead to unprecedented water level dynamic on many of those lakes12,13 .\nThe intensified hydrologic cycle , couple with the

evaporation be transform by the warming world .\nAnd the best explanation be climate change , say Drew Gronewold , a hydrologist at the University of Michigan who have be study lake level for more than a decade .\nNear the beginning of this period of regional water abundance , however , drought condition reinforce concern that high temperature and evapotranspiration foreshadow a persistent imbalance in the hydrologic cycle characterize by water loss .\nThese fluctuate hydrologic condition be manifest by water level variability on the Laurentian Great Lakes , the large system of lake on Earth .\nWe investigate the driver of change in water level across the Laurentian Great Lakes over the past seven decade .\nOver the past two decade , over-lake precipitation have rise to extraordinary level while over-lake evaporation diminish rapidly in 2014 , set the stage for the recent surge in water level .\nOver the last few decade , water level have decline slightly for most of the Great Lakes ( see Figure 1 ) .\nWater level and water temperature be two important and interrelated indicator of weather and climate change in the Great Lakes .\nWater level ( the height of the lake surface above sea level ) be influence by many factor , include precipitation , snowmelt runoff , drought , evaporation rate , and people withdraw water for multiple u .\nThese type of disruption from low water level be expect to continue a the climate change .\nIndicator Notes While climate change influence water level , human activity such a dredging can also play a role .\nCoasts , water

take place now ? .\nThese global pattern often have indirect effect on Great Lakes weather .\nTools for good forecast Rapid change in weather and water supply condition across the Great Lakes and upper Midwest be already challenging water management policy , engineering infrastructure and human behavior .\nGovernment agency and weather forecaster need new tool to assess how future climate condition may affect the Great Lakes water budget and water level , along with good shorter-term forecast that capture change condition .\nWater level have always fluctuate on the Great Lakes , but the recent extreme seesawing , particularly on the upper lakes\u2014Superior , Michigan , and Huron\u2014is unprecedented in the century that record have be keep ( see chart ) .\nLake level fluctuate accord to change in the balance between rainfall , snowmelt , and runoff in the watershed on the one hand , and evaporation and outflow on the other .\nEvaporation , though , varies widely in response to air and surface water temperature , and a good deal of the water vapor return to the lake a rainfall and lake-effect snow .\nGronewold and others have theorize that during the 15 year of high evaporation , a feedback mechanism develop in which cloud dissipate over the lake to an unusual extent and allow more solar heating of the lake .\n\u201c There be a lot of variability in response to wind and circulation with the subsurface , but the question be , What \u2019 s the heat content of the lake ? .\n< < CITING ARTICLES Water level be likely to decline somewhat in the next several month , a part of the usual seasonal cycle .\n\u201c They be at the crossroad of global circulation pattern , and there be local effect because the lake have thermal memory and water level take quite a while to drain from lake to lake .\nEvaporation over the Great Lakes be drive by the difference between the water temperature and the air temperature , and it peak when lake temperature be high , air temperature be cool , and relative humidity be low .\nGreat Lakes water level be difficult to predict week in advance due to natural variation in weather .\nThe daily average water level be an average take from a number of gauge across each lake and be a good indicator of the overall lake level when it be change relatively rapidly due to recent high precipitation .\nThe Great Lakes be already highly stress , and climate change will worsen exist threat to the Great Lakes , include make the lake more suitable for invasive specie , dry coastal wetland that filter pollution , expose toxic sediment pollution , and increase the number of intense storm lead to sewage overflow .\nPotential climate change impact include reduced water level ( due in particular to decreased winter ice cover allow more evaporation ) , increased frequency of intense storm event ( alter the timing of inflow ) , and warm water temperature .\nClimate change could change internal water cycling in the Great Lakes with long summer stratification potentially lead to large dead zone ( lack in oxygen ) .\n5 m ) and ice cover , and increase in water temperature 2-12 degree F ( or 1-7 degree C ) at surface , up to 14 degree F or 8 degree C at depth ) will in turn affect phytoplankton , zooplankton and fish .\nClimate change-induced water level decline increase the need to adopt the Great Lakes-St .\nAs lake level decline and shoreline wetland be lose , effort will be need to enhance protection , restoration , and development of wetland at low water level to retain their many function include wildlife habitat and water purification .\nClimate change have the potential to profoundly influence water supply and it quality for the Great Lakes from the surround watershed .\nThough some of that evaporation loss on Michigan and Huron have be offset by above-normal precipitation , people need to understand something have fundamentally change in the lake ' historic low-water , high-water cycle , Roebber say .\nBut he agree that the big story for Lakes Michigan and Huron be increase evaporation , only a fraction of which fall back into the lake a precipitation .\n`` We 're get the precipitation , but we 're lose a lot more water through evaporation .\nMost scientist agree that warm water and air temperature will turbo-charge Lake Michigan and Huron 's precipitation-evaporation cycle ; more water will be go up into the sky , and more will be come down .\nHe believe that average will continue to decline , but he be more concerned about how increased evaporation and precipitation cycle may push the swing around the average high and low than we 've ever see .\nWater level be start to decline , which mean next year the water level wont be as high and there wont be as much flooding .\nThe Great Lakes be very dynamic alternate between long period of high and low water level in addition to go through phase of seasonal variability .\nSo even under ideal condition for water level to decrease , we should expect above average water level for at least the next two year , if not longer .\nFall and winter be actually when most of the evaporation happen and be the time of year we typically see water level decrease .\nDuring the winter , increase evaporation also happen when there be less seasonal ice cover on lake .\nClimate change will make water level go down .\nSince this realization , the late science of lake level under a change climate now suggest that there be a few trend we can expect in the future .\nIn addition , there be evidence that weather change in the arctic may \u201c influence Great Lakes ice cover , Lake effect snow event , seasonal freeze-thaw dynamic , as well a lake level \u201d ( Gronewold , 2019 ) , which would then affect evaporation pattern currently see .\n( 2019 ) Recent water level change across Earths large lake system and implication for future variability .\nThe Great Lakes be a complicated system affect by precipitation , winter ice cover , evaporation and other factor , but there 's no clear evidence that climate change have a direct effect on how high the water be .\nExperts expect the cycle to bring water level down in coming year .\nBrent Lofgren , a physical scientist with NOAA 's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory , say he have `` difficulty with the viewpoint `` that these extreme prove a link between climate change and lake level .\nHe think climate change have some influence on lake level , but there 's too much unknown to accurately define the connection .\n`` Scientists want to understand reason and process that would link climate change or greenhouse gas to lake level and it 's not straightforward .\nTo drop the lake back to average water level would require an

the opportunity cost of the cut simply remain too high , particularly if the social contract of the last 80 year be far breach in return for more tax cut for the privileged .\nIf certain type of income be subject to multiple layer of tax , a occurs in the current system , that problem can not be solve by low rate .\nWe have the expiration of the Bush-era tax cut , all of them , which , if un-extended , would be the big tax increase in the history of the country , about $ 4 .\nEstimates vary a to how much tax would rise if the Bush-era tax cut be allow to expire fully .\nSome tax analyst have argue that , because the tax cut be intend to be temporary , their expiration do not count a a tax increase .\n`` There be no doubt , if all the ( Bush ) tax cut be allow to expire , this would have a very big impact , `` say Howard Gleckman , an analyst at the Tax Policy Center , an independent tax analysis group , and author of the blog TaxVox .\nRather , the debate center largely on whether to extend the tax break for the nation 's high earner , those take in $ 200,000 or more a year .\nThe trillion of dollar at stake this year with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cut place them among the nation 's most costly .\nBut , a historical review of other tax legislation show the cut , if allow to expire , would still amount to less than half the percentage of the Gross Domestic Product that World War II spending bill take on .",

however , achieve a sizable surplus in the rest of the budget would be a daunting and almost unachievable task , especially give the sharp increase in Medicare and Medicaid cost .\nAs President Obama say on October 3 , Medicare be \u201c the big driver of our deficit right now .\nYou can make a case that rise spending on Medicare and Medicaid contribute to deficit , since both depend partially on federal general revenue .\nBut unlike 75 year ago , the massive financial overhang from Medicare and Social Security will make it dramatically more difficult to dig ourselves out of the debt ditch .\nIn fact , spend on Social Security and the major health program ( which include Medicare , Medicaid , the Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program , and subsidy to purchase health insurance ) account for all of the increase in federal non-interest spending relative to the size of the economy over the long term .\n\u201c Frankly , it 's the health care entitlement that be the big driver of our debt , so we spend more time on the health care entitlement \u2014 because that 's really where the problem lie , fiscally speak , \u201d Ryan say .\nMedicare and Social Security continue to stand along Medicaid a some of the most popular federal spending program .",

    "evidence": "Breast cancer be the most common cancer in woman ( aside from skin cancer ) , and it \u2019 s the second leading cancer killer in woman .\nFor example , woman who have more menstrual period over their lifetime ( because their period start early , they go through menopause later , or they never get pregnant ) have a slightly high risk of breast cancer .\nPregnancy and breast cancer risk Women who have a full-term pregnancy before age 20 have a low risk of breast cancer than woman who never have a full-term pregnancy or who have their first full-term pregnancy after the age of 30 or 35 .\nSince none of the people have the disease ( like cancer ) at the start of the study , there be no chance that have the disease would have influence their memory or their willingness to report thing in their past ( like abortion ) .\nAfter adjust for know breast cancer risk factor , the researcher find that induced abortion ( s ) have no overall effect on the risk of breast cancer .\nAfter adjust for know breast cancer risk factor , the researcher find no link between either spontaneous or induced abortion and breast cancer .\nThere be no difference in breast cancer risk between the group who have either spontaneous or induced abortion and those who have not have an abortion .\nOther cohort study have look specifically at the possible link between abortion and breast cancer in African American woman and in woman who be at increased risk of breast cancer because they have mutation in the BRCA gene .\nThey find about an 11 % increase risk of breast cancer in woman who report have an induced abortion .\nIn contrast , woman with breast cancer be more likely to accurately report their reproductive history , include a history of have an abortion .\nThe expert review human and animal study that look at the link between pregnancy and breast cancer risk , include study of induced and spontaneous abortion .\nSpontaneous abortion be not link to an increase in breast cancer risk .\nMore rigorous recent study demonstrate no causal relationship between induce abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk .\n\u201d These expert do not find that abortion ( either induce or spontaneous ) cause a high breast cancer risk .\nBreast cancer be the most common cancer in woman aside from skin cancer ; and breast cancer be the second leading cancer killer in woman

and breast cancer in African-American woman .\nThe finding show a great risk of breast cancer for woman who report one or more induced abortion than for woman who have carry their fetus to term .\nThe risk vary , in a nonsignificant manner for subgroup define by age at the time of the abortion , length of gestation , lactation in late pregnancy , and family history of breast cancer .\nThis study determine that woman who undergo induce abortion have a 50 % great risk of breast cancer than woman who do not have abortion .\nIn addition , those woman report induce abortion have less favorable risk profile ( parity , age at first term pregnancy , and lactation ) than woman report spontaneous abortion .\nResearch have find no link between abortion and an increase risk of breast cancer .\nAfter adjust for potential confounders of age , parity , age at delivery of first child , and calendar period , the risk of breast cancer for woman with a history of induced abortion be not different from woman who have not have an induced abortion ( relative risk [ RR ] = 1 .\nThe number of induced abortion in a woman \u2019 s history also have no significant relation to risk of breast cancer .\nResults from this population-based prospective cohort provide strong evidence against an increase in risk of breast cancer among woman with a history of induced abortion during the first trimester .\nInduced abortion and the risk of breast cancer .\nFurther , woman who have be diagnose with breast cancer be more likely to report have have an abortion , because they be identify their early risk factor and be likely to recall one that have be cite in the press , such a abortion or oral contraceptive use .\nin this case , which woman develop breast cancer later in life .\nNone of the prospective cohort study have find a significant association between breast cancer and have have an abortion .\n4 It find that those woman be no more likely to develop breast cancer than be the 1 .\nMore than 3,300 participant develop breast cancer ; there be no difference in cancer risk between woman who have have an abortion and those who have not .\n`` woman who choose abortion suffer more and deadly breast cancer .\n, \u201c Induced and spontaneous abortion and incidence of breast cancer among young woman .\nInduced and spontaneous abortion and incidence of breast cancer among young woman .\nBecause of personal sensitivity and the stigma associate with the operation , healthy woman may be reluctant to reveal that they have have an abortion , while those with breast cancer , seek a cause for their illness , be more likely to report one .\nThe scientist find no difference in breast cancer incidence between the woman who have have spontaneous or induced abortion and those who have not .\nBreast cancer incidence do not differ among woman who have have an induced or spontaneous abortion before or after their first birth , or who have have no abortion at all .\nOther type of pregnancy , however , might increase the risk of breast cancer .\nabortion before the first live birth stop the process transform the breast during the first pregnancy , which increase the risk of breast cancer .\nDifferences between spontaneous and induced abortion a risk factor for breast cancer .\nResearch clearly show abortion ( also call induced abortion ) be not link to an increase risk of breast cancer .\nThe case in these study ( the woman with breast cancer ) may be much more likely to give complete information about their abortion history than the control ( the woman without breast cancer ) .\nFurther support the evidence that abortion be not link to an increase risk of breast cancer be find from study on miscarriage ( also call spontaneous abortion ) .\nAbortion ,

risk factor for the future development of breast cancer .\n1 Until recently , incomplete pregnancy be think to have no effect , or perhaps slightly reduce the risk of breast cancer .\nA more recent prospective study in African-American woman also find that induced abortion do not increase the risk of subsequent breast cancer .\nIndeed , if our finding of no association between miscarriage and subsequent breast cancer be valid , it be difficult to think of a credible , systematic bias that would apply exclusively to our other analysis and conceal a positive association between induce abortion and subsequent breast cancer .\nHowever , the data we have analyse and present do not support the hypothesis that miscarriage or induced abortion represent substantive risk factor for the future development of breast cancer .\nInduced abortion a an independent risk factor for breast cancer .\nDoes induce or spontaneous abortion affect the risk of breast cancer ? .\nThe risk of breast cancer follow spontaneous or induced abortion .\nInduced abortion and risk for breast cancer .\nInduced abortion and risk for breast cancer .\nInduced abortion and breast cancer risk .\nInduced

who have have an abortion or a miscarriage , compare to those who have not .\n\u201c Recent study provide little support for the hypothesis that termination increase breast cancer risk , with most suggest that induced abortion have no effect on the overall risk of breast cancer .\nThe relative risk of breast cancer increase with increase gestational age of the fetus at the time of the most recent induced abortion .\nIn comparison , among woman with a history of induced abortion , account for 2,697,000 person-years of follow-up , there be 1338 case of breast cancer .\nOverall , the risk of breast cancer in woman with a history of induced abortion be not different from that in woman without such a history , after potential confounding by age , parity , age at delivery of a first child , and calendar period be take into account ( relative risk , 1 .\nAge at the time of the induced abortion do not significantly influence the overall risk , but there be a tendency toward a high risk of breast cancer among woman in the low age category \u2014 between 12 and 19 year of age ( relative risk , 1 .\n, whether the induced abortion occur in a nulliparous woman or either before or after a live birth ) significantly influence the risk of breast cancer .\nDiscussion Our study of a population-based cohort uncover no overall increase risk of breast cancer among woman with a history of induced abortion .\n7,8,13,21-24 A recent meta-analysis find an overall increased risk of breast cancer among woman with a history of induced abortion of 1 .\nIt be possible that woman with breast cancer might be more willing to report induced abortion than healthy woman .\nHowever , we find that the risk of breast cancer among woman with a history of induced abortion be no different from that among woman without such a history , nor do we find that the number of induced abortion influence the risk of breast cancer .\nInduced abortion have no overall effect on the risk of breast cancer , but we find a statistically significant increase in risk among woman with a history of second-trimester abortion .\nThe woman who have such abortion could have have a relatively high risk of breast cancer , but we could not identify any medical condition associate with both a high risk and late induced abortion .\nNulliparous woman with a history of induced abortion do not differ from parous

Washington ; and five county in central New Jersey ) be interview about their reproductive history , include the occurrence of induced abortion .\nAmong woman who have be pregnant at least once , the risk of breast cancer in those with a prior induced abortion be 20 % high than that in woman with no history of abortion ( 95 % confidence interval 1 .\nThese data support the hypothesis that there may be a small increase in the risk of breast cancer relate to a history of induced abortion among young woman of reproductive age .\nThey conclude that have an abortion or miscarriage do not increase a woman \u2019 s subsequent risk of develop breast cancer .\nMany such hormonal change occur during pregnancy , change that may influence a woman \u2019 s chance of develop breast cancer later in life .\nFindings from some study suggest there be no increase in risk of breast cancer among woman who have have an abortion , while find from other study suggest there be an increase risk .\nThe new study consistently show no association between induce and spontaneous abortion and breast cancer risk .\nImportant Information about Breast Cancer Risk Factors At present , the factor know to increase a woman \u2019 s chance of develop breast cancer include age ( a woman \u2019 s chance of get breast cancer increase a she get old ) , a family history of breast cancer , an early age at first menstrual period , a late age at menopause , a late age at the time of birth of her first full-term baby , and certain breast condition .\n, of the National Cancer Institute 's Division of Cancer Etiology , disagree because there be many study that show no link between breast cancer and abortion .\nBreast cancer in relation to the occurrence and time of induced and spontaneous abortion .",

    "evidence": "In the event that an eligible hospital or CAH leave a blank response , the attestation will be consider incomplete , and no information will be post relate to these attestation statement .\nIn particular , the database contain only pay claim , not deny claim , and so , with respect to in-network inpatient stay , it may not reflect claim for service provide by out-of-network provider if the group plan ( say , an HMO ) , deny those out-of-network claim .\nThe Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) provide partial protection for patient receive out-of-network emergency care .\nThat be because the doctor who work in hospital often do not work for the hospital ; rather they bill patient separately and may not participate in the same health plan network that cover the in-network facility .\nIf the patient \u2019 s health plan be a Health Maintenance Organization ( HMO ) or an Exclusive Provider Organization ( EPO ) that do not provide any coverage for non-emergency care receive out of network , the surprise medical bill claim may not be cover by the health plan at all .\nWhen you use non-network hospital and facility , you must pay a high share of the cost of covered service .\nIf you have a prior confinement in a hospital , skilled nursing facility or other institution for care or treatment immediately precede the date your coverage under The Empire Plan become effective and the confinement continue on the day this Plan become effective , or you continue to be confine at home under the care of a physician or surgeon , because of a disable sickness or injury on the date your coverage under this Plan become effective , the Hospital Program will not provide benefit to the extent that you have coverage under any other health care plan , include provision for benefit after termination in the event of disability .\nIf you call the Benefits Management Program and do not receive certification for your admission and you be admit to the hospital a an inpatient , you will be responsible for all charge for each day it be not medically necessary for you to be an inpatient .\nIf only a part of your inpatient stay be certify , you will be responsible for all charge for each day on which it be not medically necessary for you to be an inpatient .\nThe applicable hospital outpatient copayment or coinsurance will be apply to the remain covered charge .\nWhen you use a non-network hospital , skilled nursing facility or hospice care facility , you be responsible for a large share of the cost of Covered Services , unless the criterion list in section C apply .\nYou be responsible for make the payment to the non-network hospital .\nInpatient Hospital Care The Plan will pay for your care when you be an inpatient in a hospital or birth center a describe below .\nThe Hospital Program will usually pay , subject to network and non-network benefit level , for all the diagnostic and therapeutic service provide by the hospital .\nOutpatient Hospital Care When you receive the service describe in the following section and subject to the limitation in those section , the Hospital Program will pay for the same service provide to you in the outpatient department of a hospital a it pay when you be an inpatient in a hospital a describe under Inpatient Hospital Care .\nHowever , the Hospital Program will not pay for follow-up care for surgery , such a removal of suture and check-up visit .\nYou will not have to pay this $ 70 copayment if you be treat in the emergency room and it become necessary for the hospital to admit you at that time a an inpatient .\nYou will not have to pay the copayments for outpatient surgical expense or hospital outpatient expense if you be treat in the outpatient department of a hospital and it become necessary for the hospital to admit you at that time a an inpatient .\nThere be no copayment for the following covered hospital outpatient service provide at a network facility .\nThe Empire Plan do not provide Skilled Nursing Facility benefit , even for short-term rehabilitative care , for Retirees , Vestees and Dependent Survivors or their Dependents who be eligible for primary benefit from Medicare .\n1 Downgraded Stays In case when a hospital utilization review committee determine that an inpatient admission do not meet the hospital \u2019 s inpatient criterion , Medicare allow the hospital to change the patient status from inpatient to outpatient and submit an outpatient claim for medically necessary service that be furnish , a long a the following requirement be meet .\nYou can not directly appeal the hospital determination that you be or be an observation patient , say Ellen Griffith , a Medicare spokeswoman .\nIf the nursing home or hospital say Medicare wont cover my nursing home stay , what can I do ? .\nThe nursing home will not bill you while you wait for a response .\nIf Medicare ultimately do not pay the nursing home , you will be responsible for the charge .\nMost hospital aren \u2019 t able to ensure compliance with regulation around dispense medication for home use like a pharmacy , so they win \u2019 t let you take the inhaler home .\nOn top of the unpleasant surprise of a large hospital bill , Medicare win \u2019 t pay for skilled nursing facility ( SNF ) care for patient who be on observation status .\nUnfortunately , it can hurt hospital patient who rely on Medicare for their health care coverage .\nPeople who receive care in hospital , even overnight and for several day , may learn they have not actually be admit a inpatient .\nMost significantly , patient will not be able to obtain any Medicare coverage if they need nurse home care after their hospital stay .\nThus , Medicare beneficiary who be enrol in Part A , but not Part B , will be responsible for their entire hospital bill if they be classify a Observation Status .\n\u200b If the patient be no longer in the hospital .\nThe patient might be able to appeal the hospital care after-the-fact , however , win Medicare coverage in Observation case be increasingly difficult .\n\u201d ( Medicare will only cover nursing home care after a 3-day inpatient hospital stay .\nIn the past , the Centers primary focus be how time in observation status and in the emergency room be not count by the Medicare program when that time be follow by a beneficiary formal admission to the hospital a an inpatient .\nNow that hospital be increasingly use observation status , however , you can not make this assumption .\nSkilled Nursing Facility ( SNF ) SNFs that believe that Medicare coverage will be deny because of a technical reason , such a a lack of the three-day qualifying hospital stay , may give the resident a Notice of Exclusion of Medicare Benefits ( NEMB ) .\nThe NEMB-SNF informs the beneficiary that , in the SNFs view , Medicare will not pay for the resident care .\nUnder a new federal law , hospital across the country must now alert Medicare patient when they be get observation care and why they be not admit -- even if they stay in the hospital a few night .\nUnless their care fall under a new Medicare bundled-payment category , observation patient pay a share of the cost of each test , treatment or other service .\nAnd if they need nurse home care to recover their strength , Medicare wo n't pay for it because that coverage require a prior hospital admission of at least three consecutive day .\nDoctors and hospital representative still have question about how to fill out the new observation care form , include why the patient have not be admit .\nThe form also explain that observation care be cover under Medicare 's Part B benefit , and patient `` generally pay a copayment for each outpatient hospital service `` and the amount can vary .\nFollowing surgery , and additional complication , hospital official tell the family she would be keep for observation but she would need to go to a nursing home to recover .\nUnder longstanding federal law and regulation , in order for a Medicare beneficiary to receive cover care in a SNF follow a hospitalization , he or she must first be consider a hospital inpatient for at least three day .\nIf the beneficiary be hold under observation , any such observation day do not count towards a qualifying inpatient stay and may result in denial of post-acute SNF benefit .\nBeneficiaries that be hold for observation be classify a hospital outpatient , and a such be not entitle to Medicare Part A coverage for the cost of their stay .\nIn this circumstance , Medicare Part B cover the associated physician service and certain tests/procedures , leave the patient liable for Part B cost-sharing and other cost of the observation stay that must be meet with other insurance or out-of-pocket payment .\nFurthermore , lack the required minimum 3-day inpatient hospital stay , such beneficiary will not be entitle to Medicare Part A SNF benefit and would be liable for the associated cost of their post-acute stay .\nInpatient hospital stay be reimburse differently from observation stay by Medicare and , hospital maintain , the federal government have not specify when it consider each type of stay to be appropriate .\nRecovery audit contractor have recently start deny large number of claim for short hospital inpatient stay , conclude after-the-fact that beneficiary could have be place in observation status and that inpatient admission be medically unnecessary .\nAs a consequence , hospital and physician have become more wary about admit patient and more likely to order observation service when they be not ready to return home but be unlikely to require a lengthy hospital stay .\nThe Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) include a provision penalize hospital if they fail to reduce preventable readmission .\nThese standard be more restrictive than Medicare rule , which allow hospital to provide observation service anywhere in the hospital , without any specific limit on the duration of observation status .\nIn propose rule on the hospital outpatient prospective payment system , CMS provide information on the Medicare Part A to Part B Rebilling Demonstration and solicit public comment on observation status .\nThe legislation would amend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to deem an individual receiving outpatient observation service in a hospital to be an inpatient with respect to satisfy the three-day inpatient hospital requirement in order to entitle the individual to Medicare coverage of any post-hospital extend care service in a SNF .\n( d ) Notwithstanding any other law , and to the extent consistent with federal law , a psychiatric health facility shall be eligible to participate in the medicare program under Title XVIII of the federal Social Security Act ( 42 U .\nHospitals provide observation care for patient who be not well enough to go home but not sick enough to be admit .\nMedicare \u2019 s Observation Care Observation patient can not receive Medicare coverage for follow-up care in a nursing home , even though their doctor recommend it .\nNo , Medicare do not pay for these routine drug for patient in the hospital in observation care .\nThe form will show what service you need , the estimate cost and the reason why Medicare will probably not pay .\nYou will not be bill until Medicare issue a decision .\nIf Medicare do not pay the bill , you will receive information on how to appeal that decision .\nFor more information on file an appeal , visit the Center for Medicare Advocacy \u2019 s observation care website .\nMedicare Savings Programs Medicare Saving Programs help pay for all or some of the Medicare monthly payment , co-pays and deductible ( money owe to the doctor if Medicare doesn \u2019 t cover the entire bill ) .\nIf a Medicare patient do not initially meet the criterion for inpatient admission but the attend physician conclude the patient should be observe in the hospital for a period of time before be send home , the patient can remain in the hospital in observation status .\nBut from Medicare 's point of view , this be outpatient care , which leave patient responsible for more of the bill , and ineligible for Medicare-paid rehab or skilled nursing care .\nFor Medicare beneficiary who be n't actually admit to a hospital .\nwill cover your hospital stay if youre assign observation status instead of be admit .\nWhat 's the difference if I 'm assigned observation status at a hospital instead of inpatient ? .\nRather , your claim will be pay under Medicare Part B , which cover outpatient care .\n( If you be admit a an inpatient and Part A cover your hospital stay , Medicare Part B will still pay for any physician service you receive , which mean you \u2019 ll owe some Part B co-insurance for any stay .\nBut if you be admit a an inpatient , youd likely pay less overall in Part A deductible and Part B coinsurance cost than if you be be classify a an observation patient your entire stay be cover by Part B .\nDoes Medicare encourage hospital to classify patient a under observation .\nThis show the financial incentive Medicare to encourage hospital to classify patient under observation from a financial perspective .\nMedicare set the admission criterion under which hospital be allow to make an inpatient admission under Part A , and Medicare auditor commonly deny hospital inpatient claim on the ground that a patient medical condition didnt require them to be admit .\nThe Center for Medicare Advocacy have also propose require only a one-night inpatient stay before Medicare will cover SNF care .\nwhich for the first time afford a specific appeal right to Medicare beneficiary classify under observation .\nMedicare will pay for up to 20 day of skilled nursing facility care during which your out-of-pocket cost be $ 0 .\nIf you stay in the hospital under observation status , youll be on your own to pay for whatever skilled nursing you need .\nIf your health insurance policy have an illegal act exclusion , that bill will be come to you .\nIn most case , a pre-authorized service will end up be cover by your health insurance , although youll have to pay whatever cost-sharing be require under the term of your plan .\nYour health insurance might not pay for your hospital stay if you be admit a an inpatient but your insurance company think you should have be in observation status .\nIf your insurance company or Medicare determine that you should have be in observation status when you be actually admit to inpatient status , the insurance company can refuse to pay the hospital bill .\nThis be particularly important for Medicare patient , since inpatient hospital care ( cover under Medicare Part A ) have one deductible that cover up to 60 day in the hospital , while outpatient care ( cover under Medicare Part B ) have a 20 % coinsurance with no cap on out-of-pocket cost .\nTime spent in the hospital a under observation doesnt count towards the hospital day require to activate Medicare coverage for a skilled nursing facility .\nThink your health insurance or Medicare will pay for nursing home care when you \u2019 re unable to care for yourself ? .\nInpatients be keep in the hospital for care , test , and monitor when they be too sick to safely go home .\nYour hospital status may also affect whether Medicare will cover care you get in a skilled nursing facility ( SNF ) follow your hospital stay .\nYou 're an outpatient if you 're get emergency department service , observation service , outpatient surgery , lab test , or X-rays , or any other hospital service , and the doctor have n't write an order to admit you to a hospital a an inpatient .\nHere be some common hospital situation and a description of how Medicare will pay .",

allow the government to borrow money to cover it exist financial obligations\u2014but unfortunately , this be only temporary .\nBut although the idea of the debt ceiling may feel distant from the life of ordinary Americans , how it \u2019 s handle in the come month could have an impact that cascade into your own financial situation .\nPresident Obama keep warn that the government may not have enough money to pay all it bill , include Social Security , if the debt ceiling impasse be n't resolve by Aug .\nBut it be not feasible for Treasury to borrow the exact amount of Social Security payment due without breach the debt limit , the official say .\nDebt ceiling squabble jeopardize Social Security payment several time in the past .\n`` Social Security payment may be delay or jeopardize if the Treasury do not have enough cash on hand to pay benefit , `` the report say .\nSome think the president be raise the specter of default on Social Security payment purely to get senior citizen up in arm about the debt crisis and put pressure on the Republicans .\nIt 's more of a best guess estimate of when the money will run out , which make it far hard to know exactly when Congress would need to act to avert potential financial catastrophe -- and increase the odds that lawmaker could accidentally trigger a default by not act soon enough .\nFailure to raise the debt ceiling in time could also halt payment that million of Americans rely on , include paycheck to federal worker , Medicare benefit , military salary , tax refund , Social Security check and payment to federal contractor .\nA 2013 report by the Treasury Department say , `` Because the debt ceiling impasse contribute to the financial market disruption , reduce confidence and increase uncertainty , the economic expansion [ in 2011 ] be no doubt weak than it otherwise would have be .\nHowever , even if the debt limit be raise quickly so that it only be bind for a few day , there would likely be lasting damage .\nAt the very least , financial market would likely anticipate such disruption a we approach the debt limit in the future .\nThose and other disruption would have enormous economic and health consequence over time , and ultimately the cut to federal spending would cause a deep recession .\nSuch an outright default on Treasury security would very likely result in severe disruption to the Treasury security market with acute spillover to other financial market and to the cost and availability of credit to household and business .\neconomy likely reflect that investor didn \u2019 t think it very likely that the debt ceiling would actually bind and , if it do , think that the impasse would be very short live .\nIts analysis show if lawmaker remain at odds after the debt ceiling be breach , nearly 6 million job would be lose , the unemployment rate would climb back up to nearly 9 % and stock price would be cut by almost a third , wipe out $ 15 trillion in household wealth .\nFor Democrats , should the effort fail , it would not only mean challenge for the debt limit but could also result in a government shutdown at the end of the month .\nShe also say that fail to

persist .\nWhile hit the debt ceiling stop the government from issue new debt to pay it bill , and could ultimately lead to default , a partial government shutdown occur when Congress hasn \u2019 t

\u2019 s extraordinary measure can not keep cash in the Treasury \u2019 s coffer for very long , particularly since the federal government run at a deficit .\nThe Treasury official acknowledge at that time that this strategy would create a worsening problem because the federal government operate at a deficit .\nWhen Im not sure what the Treasury market be go to do , it make it really hard for me to lend money because of all of the uncertainty .\na more expensive place to live for Americans but could also make both new and outstanding debt costlier .\nStock price could sink , threaten company bottom linesIf the debt ceiling be to bind , market would likely whipsaw , potentially endure immediate and steep loss that might take a while to recover even if the situation be quickly address .\nThe government could default on it debt but expert say it isnt inevitable and would ( hopefully ) be short-livedThe obvious concern with fail to raise the debt ceiling be that the government could default on it debt , mean it isnt able to make interest payment or pay back Treasury investor when their bond mature .\nEven if the debt ceiling be raise in time , Americans could feel financial
